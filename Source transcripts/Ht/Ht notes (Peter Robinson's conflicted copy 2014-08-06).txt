Ht notes

The complete manuscript had 33 quires of 8, for a total of 264 folios. The bifolium 4.5 and leaves 6 and 7 (folios 84-87) are missing from quire 11, with the eighth blank except for a catchward on the verso; the last three folios (folios 262-264) are missing from the last quire. The missing folios 84-87 appear to have been blank, with no missing text corresponding to them: SQ finishes on 83v, with the remainder of the folio left blank, followed by folio 88, blank except for the catchword on the verso, with L20 starting on the first folio of the next quire, 89r.
Question: as all the lost folios are blank, should we include them in the foliation? answer: yes, this is an irregularity, we need to take account of it.
