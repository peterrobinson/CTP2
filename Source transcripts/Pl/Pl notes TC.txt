==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

New York, Columbia University, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Plimpton MS 253

==== Notes  ====

One bifolium only survives, holding L17, FK 1-44 and 490-564. A catchword is visible on the verso of the second leaf, and the c. 450 lines missing would fill 6 bifolia, confirming that this was the outer bifolium of a quire of eight. The adaptation of L17 follows Hg (so too Ht Ii).
