Sl1 notes
The complete manuscript had 30 quires of 8 (240 folios), and additional quires to the 30 which survive.  There has been considerable loss of leaves. The whole of the first quire and the first leaf of the second quire (folio 9) are missing, so the manuscript begins on folio 10 in our foliation.	The seventh leaf is missing from the third quire (folio 23); the first leaf from the fourth quire (folio 25); the second and third leaves from quire 10 (folios 74 and 75); the sixth leaf from quire 12 (folio 94); the sixth leaf from quire 17 (folio 134); the fourth and eighth leaves from quire 18 (folios 140 and 144); the third leaf from quire 20 (folio 155).

Absent text corresponding to the missing folios is as follows:  GP 1-648 (folios 1-9); KT 721-792 (folio 23); KT 865-936 (folio 25); TG 826-end, L7 1-67(c. 75 + 67 lines); SQ 283-256 (folio 94); WBT 1225-end [c. 12 lines], FR 1-20 and presumed L10 [c. 36 lines] (folio 134); L11 15-end [c. 30 lines], SU 1-40 (folio 140); SU 259-330 (folio 144; no blank page inserted in ms); CL 603-674 (folio 155)

The ending of SU is abbreviated, as in several other mss, to omit the detail of the farting. MO stops at 680, as do other MSS. NP stops at the base of 240v, the last folio of the last extant quire, at line 604. The presence of a catchword at the base of this page suggests at least one additional quire was present in the original manuscript.
