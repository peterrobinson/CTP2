==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

London, British Library, Egerton MS 2726. Mosser: En1.

==== Original construction  ====

32 regular quires of 8 (256 folios) and one of six (quire 7): 262 folios.  

==== Missing folios  ====

None.

==== Added folios ====

A quire of eight leaves was inserted after the first leaf of quire 8 (folio 55), containing TG: these are numbered 55a1 through 55a8 in our numbering. A single folio (262a) was added at the end of the last quire, containing the end of RT, and apparently replacing a tipped-in singleton with the same text.

====  Notes  ====

Note that L20 begins " [exp]et[/exp] incipit P[exp]ro[/exp]logus Cl[exp]er[/exp]ici Oxon[exp]oniensis[/exp]", but actually introduces the Franklin and his tale.
