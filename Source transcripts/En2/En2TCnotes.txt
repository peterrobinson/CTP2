====  Notes  ====

Paul Thomas (private note) suggests that 3 folios, not 1, are missing after 253v, thus presuming that the original had links 31 and 36.  This would require that quire 32 was originally a quire of 10, which would have been the only quire of 10 in the manuscript (the missing folios in this would be 2, 6, 7, 8, all single leaves, with the existing folios 255 and 256 as leaves 9 and 10). Unless examination of the manuscript suggests evidence of a quire of 10, it is more likely that the original did not contain links 31 and 36, with NP followed directly by MA.  A single folio could contain 75 lines missing at ene of NP/start of MA.  On the other hand, the c. 120 lines of links 31 (16 lines) and 36 (104 lines), with the 75 lines missing at end NP/start MA, would be insufficient to fill three folios.
