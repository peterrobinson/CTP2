En2 notes
The complete manuscript originally had  37 regular quires of 8 (296 folios). 

En2 has suffered significant loss at the beginning (the whole of quire 1 and the first four leaves of quire 2, folios 9-12); at the end (the last six leaves of the last quire, folios 291-296); and from almost every other quire:  the two inner sheets from quire 3 (folios 19.22, 20.21); the last leaf (folio 32) from quire 4; the second leaf (folio 42) from quire 6;  leaves 4 and 8 (folios 52 and 56) from quire 7; the first two leaves (folios 57 and 58) from quire 8; the last leaf (folio 72) from quire 9; the last two leaves (folios 79 and 80) from quire 10; leaf 7 (folio 87) from quire 11; the last leaf (folio 96) from quire 12; leaves 4 and 7 (folios 108 and 111) from quire 14; the two outer sheets (folios 113.120, 114.119) and leaf 6 (folio 118) from quire 15; the outer sheet (folios 121.128) and the second leaf (folio 122) from quire 16; leaf 5 (folio 133) from quire 17; leaf 6 (folio 142) from quire 18; the first leaf (folio 145) and the second sheet (folios 146.151) from quire 19; leaves 5, 6 and 8 (folios 157, 158 and 160) from quire 20; leaf 4 (folio 164) from quire 21; leaves 5 and 6 (folios 173 and 174) from quire 22; leaves 2 and 8 (folios 178 and and 184) from quire 23; the second sheet (folios 186.191) and leaves 5, 6 and 8 (folios 189, 190 and 192) of quire 24; leaves 1, 2, 3, and 5 (folios 193, 194, 195 and 197) for quire 25; leaves 2, 4 (wrongly, 206 DWM) and 8 (folios 202, 204 and 208) from quire 26; leaves 3 and 6 (folios 211 and 214) from quire 27; the last leaf (folio 224) from quire 28; the first three leaves (folios 233, 234 and 235) from quire 30; the third sheet (folios 243.246) from quire 31; leaves 2 and 6 (folios 250 and 254) from quire 32; leaves 3 and 8 (folios 259 and 264) from quire 33; the second leaf (folio 266) from quire 34; the second leaf (folio 282) from quire 36; the inner two sheets (folios 291.294, 292.293) and last two leaves (folios 295 and 296) from quire 37.

PT suggests that 3 folios, not 1, are missing after 253v, thus presuming that the original had links 31 and 36.  This would require that quire 32 was originally a quire of 10, which would have been the only quire of 10 in the manuscript (the missing folios in this would be 2, 6, 7, 8, all single leaves, with the existing folios 255 and 256 as leaves 9 and 10). Unless examination of the manuscript suggests evidence of a quire of 10, it is more likely that the original did not contain links 31 and 36, with NP followed directly by MA.  A single folio could contain 75 lines missing at ene of NP/start of MA.  On the other hand, the c. 120 lines of links 31 (16 lines) and 36 (104 lines), with the 75 lines missing at end NP/start MA, would be insufficient to fill three folios.
