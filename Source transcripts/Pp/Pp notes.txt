Pp notes

TM L37 PA and RT are in the second part of this manuscript, originally distinct from the first part, collated and foliated separately by Mosser, with TM-RT paginated as pp. 225-377. This section comprises two quires of 16 followed by quires of 14, 18, 6 and (probably) 12; so 82 folios (164 pages). Additional pages have been pasted in after the last folio of the second quire (foliated as 32a) and after the sixth folio of the last quire (folio 76). 

We follow here our practice of foliating the manuscript so as to show what we think was its original finished state. Thus:
1. We commence the foliation with 1, as this was originally a distinct manuscript;
2.   We use foliation, not pagination, as this correlates most directly to the quire structure.
