Se notes

The manuscript originally consisted of 38 quires of 8 (304 folios).  These quires are followed by two bifolia, which are included in the traditional foliation but which may not be part of the original manuscript. The manuscript is bound with three parchment fly leaves, containing a fifteenth-century liturgical calendar. These are included in the traditional foliation, but not in this foliation.  Both the traditional foliation and this foliation ignore a sheet of manuscript music bound at the front and back, which previously was a pastedown.  The traditional foliation skipped from 174 (=folio 171) to 176 (=folio 172).

As with several other mss, MO breaks off abruptly, at MO 768, at the end of fol. 201v.
