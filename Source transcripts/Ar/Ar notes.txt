TM is in the second part of Ar, contained in two quires: one of 12 (complete), and 8 (missing the two outer sheets, leaves 1,2, 7, 8).  Following Mosser, we identify the first folio as 166; thus the four missing folios in the second quire are 178, 179, 184, and 185, corresponding to gaps in the text from TM 490 to 592 (178-179) and 807 to the end (184-185).
