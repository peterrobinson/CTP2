Ln Notes

The manuscript consists of 33 quires of 8 (264 folios) and one quire of 10, the 33rd quire: 274 folios. The first five leaves are missing from quire 1; the second leaf from quire 8 (folio 58); the fourth leaf from quire 9 (folio 68); the last leaf from quire 11 (folio 88). PA breaks off at the end of the last surviving quire in PA 565, with the last pages damaged. Around two quires of 8 would have been needed to accommodate the missing text of PA.

Absent text corresponding to the missing folios is as follows: GP 1-382 (folios 1-5); L3 15-end, CO 1-50 (folio 58); ML 574-650 (folio 68); ME 305-382 (folio 88); PA 566-end (missing quires at end).

Unusually (uniquely?) L17 is divided, with 1-22 used as a headlink to WBP. The first 17 lines are written by Mosser's scribe B into a 17 line space left by Mosser's scribe A, 18-22 in the margin.
