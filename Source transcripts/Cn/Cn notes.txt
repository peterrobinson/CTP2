The complete manuscript, according to Mosser, had 19 quires of twelve folios (228 folios), 8 quires of 8 (64), 2 of 10 (20), and one of 6:318 folios.  The first three leaves are missing from quire 1 (folios 1-3), leaves 2, 4 and 9 from quire 2 (folios 14, 16 and 21), the first leaf from quire 7 (folio 71); leaf 7 from quire 25 (outside the Tales), and the final two leaves from the last quire, 30 (folios 317-318): 10 folios, and so 308 extant folios, as in Mosser's numbering.  Quire 10 is anomalous: the last leaf (folio 118) has been removed and a singleton leaf inserted two leaves earlier, after folio 115, but without any loss or disorder of text. Keiser, cited by Mosser, explained this by an error of copying, resulting from the bifolia being disarranged so that the text which should have been copied onto the tenth leaf (the conjunct of the third leaf) was actually copied onto the twelfth leaf (the conjunct of the first leaf). According to this scenario, the scribe corrected this by removing this last leaf, copied its text onto a replacement singleton and inserted it after the ninth leaf (folio 115), where it continues the text on the previous folio.  We count this additional leaf as 115a (109, in Mosser's numbering). Thus, there is no loss of text corresponding to the absent folio 118.

Loss of text corresponding to the missing leaves is as follows: GP 1-152 (folios 1-3,  apparently removed when the manuscript was stolen from Deene Park in 1915); KT 86-164 (folio 14); KT 243-324 (folio 16); KT 652-734 (folio 21); ML 998-1064, WBP 1-5 (folio 71).
