Now sith that I haue declared yow what thyng is penitence 
Now shul ye vnderstonde that ther been iij  accions of penitence  
 </ab><ab n="22">(base) The firste is that if a man be baptised after that he hath synned   </ab>
<lb/><ab n="23">(base) Seint 
Augustyn seith but he be penitent for his olde synful lyf he may 
nat bigynne the newe clene lyf  </ab><ab n="24">(base) for certes if he be baptised with 
oute penitence of his olde gilt he receyueth the mark of baptesme but nat the grace ne the remissioun of hise synnes til he haue repentance verray  </ab><ab n="25">(base) Another defaute is this that men doon 
deedly synne after that they han receyued baptesme  </ab><ab n="26">(base) The

hem is solempne  Another is commune  and the thridde is priuee  </ab>

to be put out of holy chirche in lente for slaughtre of children

openly of which synne the fame is openly spoken in the contree 
and thanne holy chirche by Iugement destreyneth hym for to 
doon open penance  </ab><ab n="31">(base) Commune penaunce is that preestes enioynen 
men communly in certeyn cas as for to goon parauenture naked in 
pilgrymage or barefoot  </ab><ab n="32">(base) Pryuee penaunce is thilke that men 
doon al day for priuee synnes of whiche we shryue vs pryuely

what bihoueth and is necessarie to verray  parfit penitence and

hym that is verray repentant right as the roote of a tree hideth
