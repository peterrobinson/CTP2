Ha3 notes
Ha3 is a large manuscript composed, according to Mosser, of six booklets, with the Tales occupying most of the third booklet.  The original manuscript had 32 quires of 8, with the Tales starting on the fifth leaf of the ninth quire, and hence on folio 69 in our reconstructed foliation. The Tales continues to the sixth leaf of the twentieth quire, thus folio 158 in our foliation (Mosser: folios 37 to 118).
Within the range of quires holding the Tales, the whole of the fourteenth quire is missing (folios 105-112).  The absent text corresponding to the missing folios is ME 875-end (c. 300 lines; ? WBP, WBT, c. 1230 lines; L10 c. 36 lines: 
FR 1-76, a total of c. 1630 lines -- the eight folios would carry around 1632 lines, at 51 lines a column, 102 a page, 204 a folio). The last leaf containing text of the Tales, folio 158r, ends with PA 179, the verso is blank, and is followed by a stub (folio 159), and then a blank folio (160) before the Confessio Amantis beginning the 21st quire.
