==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

Philadelphia, Rosenbach Museum and Library, Rosenbach 1084/2. Mosser: Ox2.

==== Original construction  ====

The surviving leaves held in the Rosenbach library consist of three bifolia and five single leaves. We number these as Folios 57, 58, 61, 63, 64 (as bifolia 1.8, 2.7 and leaf 5) of an original quire 8; Folios 75 and 78 (bifolium 3.6) of an original quire 10; and four leaves arbitrarily numbered 87, 95, 103, 111.

==== Notes  ====

We here follow the suggestion of Manly and Rickert, followed by Mosser: that two of these bifolia and a single leaf are remnants of a single quire (as the two outer bifolia 1.8 2.7 and leaf 5), which itself was originally the eighth quire of the manuscript. The third bifolium (3.6) comes from the tenth quire. It is not possible to judge how many quires and folios fall between this tenth quire and the other four single leaves, or between the four leaves.

Accordingly: the first surviving leaf, starting with RE 326, is the first quire of quire 8, hence folio 57. The bifolium 3.6 and fourth leaf (folios 59-60, 62) are missing from this quire; all of quire 9 (folios 65-72) is missing, the innermost and two outer bifolia are missing from quire 10, leaving only the bifolium 3.6 (folios 75 and 78) from this quire. The remaining four leaves are arbitrarily numbered 87, 95, 103, 111.

Here is what we have:

==== Concordance of the traditional foliation (as reported by Mosser) and the new foliation  ====
