==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

London, British Library Harley MS 1239. Mosser: Ha1.

==== Original construction  ====

Fourteen regular quires of eight: 112 folios.  

==== Missing folios  ====

Folios 4 and 5 are missing from quire 1; folio 88 from quire 11; the bifolium 107.110 from quire 14.

ML 677-800 (folio 88; a blank folio is bound in its place); FK 415-533 (folio 107); FK 745-846 (folio 110).

==== Notes  ====

The manuscript begins with a full text of Troilus and Criseyde, folios 1r-64v.  The Knight's Tale begins a new quire on 65r (commencing at KT 35), and is followed with another four of the Canterbury Tales.  ML starts on 82v (=80v; not 88r as DWM asserts); WBT on 91r (DWM 88r); CL (with L13 following) on 94r; FK on 104r at line 81.  A six-line passage is inserted between the end of CL and line 81 of FK, by way of introducing FK.

Note the absence of some linking text:  KT begins at 35; L7 is missing; WBT and not WBP; CL begins at 57.
