==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

Oxford, Christ Church, MS 152. Mosser: Ch. 
 
==== Original construction  ====

16 quires of 20 (320 folios), two of  10 folios, and one of six folios: 346 folios.

==== Missing folios  ====

The first leaf of the second quire (folio 21); leaf 11 of quire 6 (folio 101, a stub);leaf 8 of quire 13 (folio 238,  a stub); bifolia 1.10 2.9 and leaves 6,7 and 8 of quire 15 (folios 271-272 and 276-280).

==== Added folios  ====

None.

==== Absent text corresponding to the missing folios  ====

KT 696-776 (folio 21);  L33 74-166 (folio 238); PA 814-869 (folios 271-272); PA 971-end and RT (folios 276-280). There is a blank page at 24r, with 'vacat' written on it, but no loss of text (23v ends KT 890, 24v starts 891). There is no loss of text corresponding with folio 101, as CL 50 on 100v is followed by CL 51 on 102r. Folio 230v is blank, following the end of PL, with NU starting on 231r.

==== Notes  ====

The Tales finishes at the end of quire 15. There is misbinding but no loss of folios from quire 16 on, containing works by Lydgate and Hoccleve. The whole manuscript is written on paper except for a single parchment flyleaf.  The foliation on the manuscript, followed by Mosser, includes the flyleaf.  As it was written on by the second scribe, who was not responsible for the text of the Tales, and so appears a late addition, we do not include it in this foliation.

There is an error in the foliation sequence in quire 2. In the original numbering, there should be a folio missing after folio 21 (our folio 20).  But the original numbering numbers the next folio 22, and then skips a folio to 24, so making it appear as if the missing folio follows folio 22, not folio 21. The original numbering skips the stubs of 102 and 239, corresponding to the missing 101 and 238 in our numbering, and also skips folios 271-272 (original 272 and 273).
