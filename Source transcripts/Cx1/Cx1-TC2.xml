<lb/>penytence or penaunce / And wyte whens it is cleped

<lb/>of penitence / And whiche thynges behouen and apper-

<lb/>and desireth the lyf pardurable / ther is to hym no thyng

<lb/>god / For whiche dauid the prophete saith / I haue loued thy 
<lb/>lawe and hated wickednes / he that loueth god kepeth his

<lb/>¶ First man shal Remembre hym of his synnys / </ab><ab n="60">But 
<lb/>loke that Remembraunce be to hym no delyte by no weye 
<lb/>but grete shame and sorow for his gylte . / For Iob 
<lb/>sayth / Synful men doon werkis worthy of confusion / . </ab>
<lb/><ab n="61">And therfore sayth Ezechyel / I wyl Remembre me 
<lb/>al the yeris of my lyf in bitternes of my herte / . </ab><ab n="62">And 
<lb/>god saith in the Apocalips / Remembre you fro whens 
<lb/>that ye befalle / . For befor the tyme that ye synned ye 
<lb/>were the children of god and lymys of the Regne of 
<lb/>god / . </ab><ab n="63">But for your synne ye ben waxen thral and

<lb/><ab n="68">¶ The second cause that ought to make a man haue des

<lb/>doth synne is thrall to synne . / And synne putteth a 
<lb/>man in grete thraldom . </ab><ab n="69">And therfore saith the prophete

<lb/>that haue disdayn to be seruauntes and thrall to synne . 
<lb/>Sore to be a shamed of hym self / </ab><ab n="79">that god of his endles 
<lb/>goodnes hath sette in high astate or yeue hym strength of 
<lb/>body / beaute / prosperyte / </ab><ab n="80">and bought hym fro the deth with 
<lb/>his herte blood / that they so vnkyndely agaynst his gen-

<lb/><pb n="330v" facs="328v.jpg"/>
<lb/>ought to meue a man to cortrycon is drede of the day of 
<lb/>dome / And the horrible paynes of helle / . </ab><ab n="85">For as saith 
<lb/>saint Iherome / At euery tyme that I remembre of the day

<lb/>not ete in vntyme ne sitte the lenger at his table for he fas 
<lb/>tith / </ab><ab n="978">Thenne shalt thou vnderstande that bodily peyne ston 
<lb/>deth in disciplyne or techyng by worde or by wrytyng / or

<lb/><ab n="980">And therfore saith saynt Poule / Clothe you as they that 
<lb/>ben chosen of god in herte / of mysericorde . debonairte . suf-
<lb/>fraunce and suche maner of clothyng / in whiche Ihesu crist 
<lb/>is more apaid than in an heyr or habergeon / </ab><ab n="981">than is disci-

<lb/>or other frendis / </ab><ab n="983">Thenne shalt thou vnderstande whiche 
<lb/>thinges distourblen penaunce / And this is in thre ma-
<lb/>ners that is drede / shame / and wanhope that is desperacion </ab>
<lb/><ab n="984">And for to speke of drede / for whiche he weneth he may suf 
<lb/>fre no penaunce / </ab><ab n="985">ther ayenst is remedye for to thynke that 
<lb/>bodely penaunce is but short atte regarde of helle / that is 
<lb/>cruel and so longe that it lastyth withouten ende . </ab><ab n="986">Now 
<lb/>ayenst shame that a man hath to shryue hym / Sholde a </ab>
<lb/><ab n="987">man thynke by way of reson / that he hath not be a shamed 
<lb/><pb n="372v" facs="370v.jpg"/>
<lb/>to do foule thing / Certis hym ought not to be ashamed 
<lb/>to do feir thingis and good thyngis / And that is con-
<lb/>fessyons / </ab><ab n="988">A man shold thynke that god woot al his

<lb/>hyd ne couerid / </ab><ab n="989">Men shold eke remembre hem of the shame 
<lb/>that is to come at the day of dome to hem / that be not peny-
<lb/>tent in this present lif . </ab><ab n="990">For al the creaturis in heuene and 
<lb/>in erthe and in helle shul see appertly al that they hiden in 
<lb/>this world / </ab><ab n="991">Now for to speke of hem that ben so necligent 
<lb/>and slowe to shriue hem / it stondeth in two maners / </ab><ab n="992">That 
<lb/>one is that he hopeth to liue longe / and forto purchace muche 
<lb/>riches for his delyte / And thenne wil he shriue hym as he 
<lb/>saith / he may as hym semeth tymely ynow come to shrifte </ab>
<lb/><ab n="993">Another is the surquydrye that he hath in Cristes mercy . </ab>
<lb/><ab n="994">And ayenst the first he shal thynke that our lyf is in no 
<lb/>sikernes / And eke that alle the riches of the world is in 
<lb/>auenture ⁊ passyng as a shadowe on a wal / </ab><ab n="995">And as saith 
<lb/>seint Gregore That it apperteyneth to the grete rightwys 
<lb/>nesse of god / that neuer shal the peyne stynte of them that 
<lb/>neuer wold withdrawe hem from synne her thankis but euer 
<lb/>contynued in synne / For that perpetuel will to do synne . 
<lb/>shal they haue perpetuel peyne / </ab><ab n="996">Wanhope is in two maners 
<lb/>The first wanhope is in the mercy of god / That other is 
<lb/>that they thinke that they may not longe perseuere in good-
<lb/>nes / </ab><ab n="997">The first wanhope cometh of that he demeth that he hath 
<lb/>synned so gretly / so ofte / and so longe leyn in synne that he 
<lb/>shal not be saued / </ab><ab n="998">Certis ayenst þ<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cursid wanhope he sholde 
<lb/>thinke that the passion of Ihesu is more stronge to vnbynde 
<lb/>than synne is to bynde / </ab><ab n="999">And ayenst the seconde wanhope 
<lb/><pb n="373r" facs="371.jpg"/>
<lb/>he shal thynke that as ofte as he fallith / he shal arysen by 
<lb/>penytence / And though he neuer so longe haue leyn in synne 
<lb/>The mercy of Crist is alway redy to resceyue hym to mercy </ab>
<lb/><ab n="1000">Ayenst the wanhope that he demyth that he shold not longe 
<lb/>perseuere in goodnes / he shal thynke that the febilnes of 
<lb/>the deuyl may no thing do but men wol suffre hym / </ab><ab n="1001">And 
<lb/>eke he shal haue strengthe of god and of alle holy chirche 
<lb/>and of the protectyon of aungellis yf hym list / </ab><ab n="1002">Thenne 
<lb/>shulle men vnderstonde what is the fruyt of penaunce / and 
<lb/>after the word of Ihesu Crist / it is endeles blisse of heuene </ab>
<lb/><ab n="1003">There ioye hath no contrariosite of woo ne greuaunce / there 
<lb/>alle harmys be past of this present lyf / there as is sikernes 
<lb/>fro the peynes of helle / there as is the blessid companye that 
<lb/>reioysen euermore eueriche of others Ioye / </ab><ab n="1004">there as the body

<lb/>feble and mortal / Is inmortal and so stronge and so hool 
<lb/>that ther may no thing enpayre hit / </ab><ab n="1005">there as neyther is hun
