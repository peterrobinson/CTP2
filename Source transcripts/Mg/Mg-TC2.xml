<lb/>thy shrift sholde be ful of teeris if man may and if man may nat wepe with hise bodily eyen lat hym wepe in herte  </ab><ab n="920">(base) swich was the confession of seint Peter for after that he hadde forsake Ihesu crist he wente out and weep ful bitterly </ab><ab n="921">(base) The fourthe signe is that he ne lette nat

<lb/>what place and eek the drecchynge of o synne draweth 
<lb/>In another </ab><ab n="927">(base) and eek the lenger that he tarieth the ferther he is fro crist 
<lb/>And if he abide to his laste day scarsly may he shryuen hym or remembre

<lb/><ab n="928">(base) and for as muche as he ne hath nat in his lyf herkned Ihesu crist whanne he 
<lb/>hath spoken he shal crie to Ihesu crist at his laste day and scarsly wol he herkne hym </ab><ab n="929">(base) And vnderstond that this condicioun moste han foure thynges Thi 
<lb/>shrift moste be prueyed bifore and auysed for wikked haste dooth no profit

<lb/>is enclyned </ab><ab n="932">(base) Also thou shalt shryue thee of alle thy synnes to o man 
<lb/>and nat a percel to o man and a percel to another that is to vnderstonde in 
<lb/>entente to deperte thy confessioun as for shame or drede for it nys but stranglynge of thy soule  </ab><ab n="933">(base) For certes Ihesu crist is entierly al good in hym nys noon 
<lb/>inperfeccioun and therfore outher he foryeueth al perfitly or neuer a deel </ab><ab n="934">(base) I 
<lb/>seye nat that if thow be assigned to the Penitauncer for certein synne that 
<lb/>thow art bounde to shewen hym al the remenaunt of thy synnes of 
<lb/>whiche thow hast be shryuen to thy curaat but if it like to thee of 
<lb/>thyn humylitee this is no departynge of shrifte  </ab><ab n="935">(base) ne I seye nat 
<lb/>ther as I speke of diuisioun of confessioun that if thou haue licence for 
<lb/>to shryue thee to a discreet and an honeste preest where thee liketh and 
<lb/>by licence of thy curaat that thow ne mayst wel shryue thee to him 
<lb/>of alle thy synnes  </ab><ab n="936">(base) but lat no blotte be bihynde lat no synne been

<lb/>First that thow shryue thee by thy free wil noght constreyened ne for shame 
<lb/>of folk ne for maladie ne swiche thynges for it is resoun that he that trespaseth by his free wyl that by his free wyl he confesse his trespas  </ab><ab n="939">(base) and that
