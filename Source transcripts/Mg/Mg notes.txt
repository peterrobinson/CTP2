Mg notes

The complete manuscript had 36 quires of 8 (288 folios), and one quire of 6 (quire 27): 294 folios. Quires 11 and 29 (folios 81-88 and 223-230) are missing, as are the last seven leaves of the last quire (folios 288-294). 

It appears the scribe duplicated the text of fol. 194v on a single leaf. This is pasted to the first of three parchment fly leaves at the end of the manuscript, after quire 37. We number this leaf as 287a.

This foliation excludes three fly leaves at the beginning of the manuscript.

According to Mosser, quire 29 is missing: this should be 

Absent text corresponding to the missing folios is as follows: ML 646 end; L8 (presumed); SQ 1-157  (folios 81-88; sufficient to hold around 600 lines: 418 from ML, 28 from L8; 156 from SQ, hence 602 lines); TM 385-855 (folios 223-230); PA 927- end  (folios 288-end)

Note: omission of TM 170-203 on fol 219r (exactly as in Lc)
