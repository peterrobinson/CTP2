En3 notes
This manuscript is  unusual in its construction: 26 quires containing mostly half-sheet singletons sewn together into quires containing from 2 to 18 folios, with 341 folios in total.  DWM suggests the last folio, currently holding two leaves, was originally a quire of 4; he numbers the second last folio as '240', correctly '340'.
Folios 98 and 99 are bound in reverse order.
