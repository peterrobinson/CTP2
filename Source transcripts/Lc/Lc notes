Lc Notes

Mosser states that the manuscript was originally composed of 36 quires of 8 and a final quire of 6: hence, 294 folios. (This corrects the first version of his catalogue, in which his count of quires skipped quire 27, and he numbered fourteen folios in the final quire of six.) The first leaf of quire 27, folio 209, is missing. Absent text corresponding to the missing folio 209 is L28 41-end; TM 1-31.

A distinctive feature of the manuscript is that several leaves have been removed, replaced by seventeenth century pages, and the text recopied onto them.  The replacement leaves are numbered as "1a", where "1" is the number of the folio removed and replaced.  The original leaves removed are: the first leaf of the first quire (folio 1); the fifth leaf of quire 12 (folio 93); the fifth leaf of quire 16 (folio 125); the sixth leaf of quire 26 (folio 206); the fifth leaf of quire 37 (folio 293); the last leaf of this last quire is blank.
