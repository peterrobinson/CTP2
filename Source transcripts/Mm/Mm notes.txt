originally: 29 quires of 8, plus a quire of 16 (the 8th) and one of 4 (the 9th).  The eighth quire is a composite, consisting of 16 leaves.  From Mosser's description: this quire was created from an original gathering of 12 with a bifolium inserted after the third leaf (folio 59). The text is copied continuously across the quire. The first leaf of quire 10 (folio 77) is a stub, with no loss of text: MO finishes on 76v, with a space left after the end of the text (the last leaf of quire 9); L7, unusually following MO, begins on 78r.  This supports the hypothesis, that scribes commonly began a new tale on the SECOND leaf of a quire, leaving the first for connecting matter. In this case, no connecting matter arrived, and the first leaf was removed.

The first folio of the first quire is lost (folio 1).

SU end is abbreviated, as it is in many other mss.

Lost text: GP 1-90 (folio 1).
