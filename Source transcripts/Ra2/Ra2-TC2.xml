<lb/>wel that a coueitous man ne kan nat deme ne thenke but oonly 
<lb/>to fulfille the ende of his coueitise </ab><ab n="164">(base) and certes that ne may neuere

<lb/>is this that he that soone demeth soone repenteth </ab><ab n="168">(base) Sire ye ne 
<lb/>ben nat alwey in lyke disposicioun </ab><ab n="169">(base) for certes som thyng that som 
<lb/>tyme semeth to yow that it is good for to do another tyme it semeth to yow the contrarie </ab><ab n="170">(base) whan ye han taken conseil in your 
<lb/>self and han demed by good deliberacioun swich thyng as 
<lb/>yow semeth best </ab><ab n="171">(base) Thanne rede I yow that ye kepe it secree </ab><ab n="172">(base) biwrey nat youre conseil to no persone but if so be that ye wenen 
<lb/> sikerly that thurgh yowre bywreyyng youre condicioun shal ben to 
<lb/>yow moore profitable  </ab><ab n="173">(base) For Ihus Syrak seith  Neither to thy foo 
<lb/>ne to thy freend discouere nat thy secree ne thy folie </ab><ab n="174">(base) for they 
<lb/>wol yeue yow audience and lokyng and supportacioun in thy presence and scorne thee in thyn absence </ab><ab n="175">(base) Another clerk seith that 
<lb/>scarsly shaltow fynden any persone that may kepe conseil secrely </ab><ab n="176">(base) The book seith whil that thow kepest thy conseil in thyn herte 
<lb/>thow kepest it in thy prison </ab><ab n="177">(base) And whan thow biwreyest thy

<lb/>fore yow is bettre to hide youre conseil in youre herte than 
<lb/>preyen hym to whom ye haue biwreyed youre conseil that he 
<lb/>wol kepen it cloos and stille </ab><ab n="179">(base) For Seneca seith If so be that thou 
<lb/>ne mayst nat thyn owene conseil hyde  how dorstow preyen 
<lb/>any oother wight thy conseil secrely to kepe  </ab><ab n="180">(base) But nathelees 
<lb/>if thow wene sikerly that thy biwreyyng of thy conseil to a 
<lb/>persone wol maken thy condicion to stonden in the bettre plyt 
<lb/>thanne shaltow telle hym thy conseil in this wise </ab><ab n="181">(base) First 
<lb/>thow shalt make no semblant wheither thee were leuere pees 
<lb/>or werre or this or that ne shewe hym nat thy wyl and thyn 
<lb/>entente </ab><ab n="182">(base) for trust wel that comunely thise conseillours ben flaterers </ab><ab n="183">(base) namely the conseillours of grete lordes </ab><ab n="184">(base) for they enforcen hem 
<lb/>alwey rather to speke plesante wordes enclynynge to the 
<lb/>lordes lust than wordes that ben trewe or profitable </ab><ab n="185">(base) And therfore 
<lb/>men seyn that the riche man hath selde good conseil but if he 
<lb/>haue it of hym self </ab><ab n="186">(base) And after that thow shalt considere 
<lb/>thy freendes and thyne enemys </ab><ab n="187">(base) And as touchynge thy freendes thow shalt considere whiche of hem that been moost 
<lb/>feithfull and moost wise and eldest and moost approued in conseillyng </ab><ab n="188">(base) and of hem shaltow axe thy conseil as the cas requyreth </ab><ab n="189">(base) I seye that first ye shul clepe to youre conseyl 
<lb/>youre freendes that ben trewe  </ab><ab n="190">(base) For Salomon seith that right 
<lb/>as the herte of a man deliteth in sauour that is soote  right 
<lb/>so the conseil of trewe freendes yeueth swetnesse to the soule </ab><ab n="191">(base) He seith also ther may no thyng be likned to the trewe freend  </ab><ab n="192">(base) for certes gold ne siluer ben noght so muche worth as the 
<lb/>goode wyl of a trewe freend  </ab><ab n="193">(base) And eek he seith that a trewe 
<lb/>freend is a strong defense who so that it fyndeth certes he 
<lb/>fyndeth a gret tresor </ab><ab n="194">(base) Thanne shul ye eek considere if that youre 
<lb/>trewe freendes been discrete and wise for the book seith  Axe 
<lb/>alwey thy conseil of hem that been wise </ab><ab n="195">(base) And by this same 
<lb/>  reson shul ye clepen to youre conseil of yowre freendes that 
<lb/>ben of age swiche as han seighen and ben expert of manye 
<lb/>thynges and ben approued in conseilynges </ab><ab n="196">(base) for the book seith that 
<lb/>in olde men is the sapience and in longe tyme the Prudence </ab><ab n="197">(base) And Tullius seith that grete thynges ne ben nat ay acompliced by strengthe ne by delyuernesse of body but 
<lb/>by good conseil by Auctoritee of persones and by Science the 
<lb/>whiche thre thynges ne been nat fieble by age but certes 
<lb/>they enforcen and encressen day by day </ab><ab n="198">(base) And thanne shal 
<lb/>ye kepe this for a general rule  First shal ye clepe to youre conseil a fewe of youre freendes that ben especiale  </ab><ab n="199">(base) For 
<lb/>Salomon seith manye freendes haue thow but among a 
<lb/>thousand chees thee oon to be thy conseillour </ab><ab n="200">(base) for al be it 
<lb/>so that thow first ne telle thy conseil but to afewe thow 
<lb/>mayst afterward telle it to mo folk if it be nede </ab><ab n="201">(base) but 
<lb/>looke alwey that thy conseillours haue thilke thre condicions that I haue seyd bifore that is to seye that they be trewe wise and of old experience </ab><ab n="202">(base) And werk nat alwey in 
<lb/>euery nede by o conseillour allone for som tyme bihoueth it to be conseiled by manye </ab><ab n="203">(base) for Salomon seith Saluacion of thynges is wher as ther ben manye conseilours </ab><ab n="204">(base) Now sith that I haue told yow of which folk ye sholde be 
<lb/>conseilled  now wol I teche yow which conseil ye oghte 
<lb/>eschue </ab><ab n="205">(base) First ye shul eschue the conseillyng of fooles 
<lb/>for Salomon seith take no conseil of a fool for he ne kan 
<lb/>nat conseille but after his owene lust and his affeccioun </ab><ab n="206">(base) The book seith that the propretee of a fool is this  he troweth 
<lb/>lightly harm of euery wight and lightly troweth alle bountee 
<lb/>in hym self </ab><ab n="207">(base) Tow shalt eek eschue the conseillyng of alle 
<lb/>flaterers swiche as enforcen hem rather to preise youre persone by flaterye  than for to telle yow the soothfastnesse 
<lb/>of thynges </ab><ab n="208">(base) Wherfore Tullius seith Among alle the 
<lb/>pestilences that been in frendshipe the gretteste is flaterye 
<lb/>And therfore is it moore nede that thow eschue and drede flaterers than any oother peple  </ab><ab n="209">(base) The book seith thow shalt 
<lb/>rather drede and flee fro the swete wordes of flaterynge 
<lb/>preiseres than fro the egre wordes of thy freend that seith 
<lb/>thee thy sothes </ab><ab n="210">(base) Salomon seith that the wordes of a flaterere is a Snare to cacchen Innocentz  </ab><ab n="211">(base) he seith also that 
<lb/>he that speketh to his freend wordes of swetnesse and of 
<lb/> plesance setteth a Net biforn his feet to cacchen hym  </ab><ab n="212">(base) And therfore seith Tullius  Enclyne nat thyne erys to flatereres ne 
<lb/>tak no conseil of wordes of flaterye </ab><ab n="213">(base) And Caton seith  Auyse 
<lb/>thee wel and eschue wordes of swetnesse and of plesance </ab><ab n="214">(base) And 
<lb/>eek thow shalt eschue the conseillyng of thynne olde enemys 
<lb/>that ben reconsiled  </ab><ab n="215">(base) The book seith that no wight retourneth 
<lb/>saufly in to the grace of his olde enemy  </ab><ab n="216">(base) And Ysope seith Ne 
<lb/>trust nat to hem to whiche thow hast had som tyme werre or 
<lb/>enemytee ne telle hem nat thy conseil  </ab><ab n="217">(base) And Seneca telleth 
<lb/>the cause why  It may nat be seith he that where as greet 
<lb/>fyr hath longe tyme endured that ther ne dwelleth som vapour of warmnesse  </ab><ab n="218">(base) And ther fore seith Salomon  In thyn 
<lb/>olde foo trust neuere </ab><ab n="219">(base) for sikerly thogh thyn enemy be reconsiled 
<lb/>and maketh thee cheere of humylitee and louteth to thee with his 
<lb/>heed ne trust hym neuere </ab><ab n="220">(base) for certes he maketh thilke feyned 
<lb/>humylitee moore for his profit than for any loue of thy persone by cause that he demeth to haue victorie ouer thy persone by 
<lb/>swich feyned continance the which victorie he myghte nat 
<lb/>haue by strif or werre </ab><ab n="221">(base) And Peter Alfonce seith  Make 
<lb/>no felaweshipe with thyne olde enemys for if thow do hem 
<lb/>bountee they wol peruerten it in to wikkednesse </ab><ab n="222">(base) And eek thou 
<lb/>most eschue the conseillyng of hem that ben thy seruantz 
<lb/>and beren thee gret reuerence for par auenture they seyn it 
<lb/>moore for drede than for loue </ab><ab n="223">(base) and therfore seith a Philosophre in this wise  Ther is no wight parfitly trewe to 
<lb/>hym that he to soore dredeth  </ab><ab n="224">(base) And Tullius seith Ther nys 
<lb/>no myght so gret of any Emperour that longe may endure 
<lb/>but if he haue moore loue of the peple than drede </ab><ab n="225">(base) Thou 
<lb/>shalt also eschue the conseillyng of folk that ben dronke

<lb/> the conseilyng of sherewes </ab><ab n="231">(base) Thow shalt also eschue

<lb/>thou shalt considere that in thilke thyng that thow purposest and 
<lb/>vp on what thyng thow wolt haue conseil that verray trouthe

<lb/>roote is engendred the matere of thy conseil and what fruyt 
<lb/>it may conceyue and engendre </ab><ab n="242">(base) Thow shalt eek considere alle

<lb/>ye haue examyned youre conseil as I haue seyd and which

<lb/> performe a werk of which thow shalt repente thanne is it bettre 
<lb/>that thow suffre than bigynne  </ab><ab n="253">(base) wel seyn they that defenden euery

<lb/>is affermed so strongly that it may nat be chaunged for no condicioun that may bityde I seye that thilke conseil is wikked </ab><ab n="264">(base) This Melibeus whan he hadde herd the doctrine of his wyf

<lb/>myghten falle of this vengeance  </ab><ab n="461">(base) But who so wolde

<lb/>to pacience </ab><ab n="537">(base) Forther moore ye sholde enforce yow to haue 
<lb/>pacience </ab><ab n="538">(base) considerynge that the tribulacions of this world but 
<lb/>litel while endure and soone passed been and goon </ab><ab n="539">(base) And the ioye 
<lb/>that a man seketh to haue by pacience in tribulaciouns  is pardurable after that the Apostle seith in his Epistle </ab><ab n="540">(base) The ioye of 
<lb/>god he seith is pardurable that is to seyn euere lastynge </ab><ab n="541">(base) Also troweth and bileueth stedefastly that he nys noght wel ynorisshed ne wel ytaught that kan nat haue pacience or wol

<lb/>to be pacient than for to be right strong </ab><ab n="546">(base) And he that may haue the lordshipe of his owene herte  is moore to preyse

<lb/>That he is coupable that entremetteth hym or medleth with

<lb/>Alfonce  Oon of the gretteste Aduersitees of this world is </ab><ab n="597">(base) whan a free man by kynde or of burthe is constreyned 
<lb/>by pouerte to eten the almesse of his enemy  </ab><ab n="598">(base) And the 
<lb/>same seith Innocent in oon of his bookes  he seith That 
<lb/>sorweful and myshappy is the condicioun of a poore beggere </ab><ab n="599">(base) for if he axe nat his mete  he dyeth for hungir </ab><ab n="600">(base) And if he axe he dyeth for shame and algates necessitee constreyneth

<lb/>Bettre it is to dye of bitter deeth than for to lyuen in swich

<lb/>shul geten hem with outen greet desir by good leiser sekyngly 
<lb/>and nat ouer hastily   </ab><ab n="607">(base) For a man that is to desirynge to geten 
<lb/>richesses abandoneth hym first to thefte and to alle othere yueles  </ab><ab n="608">(base) And ther fore seith Salomon  he that hasteth hym to bisily to wexe riche shal be noon Innocent  </ab><ab n="609">(base) He seith also that 
<lb/>the richesse that hastily cometh to a man  soone and lightly gooth 
<lb/>and passeth from a man  </ab><ab n="610">(base) But that richesse that cometh litel and 
<lb/>litel wexeth alwey and multiplieth  </ab><ab n="611">(base) And sire ye shullen gete

<lb/>persone  </ab><ab n="613">(base) For the lawe seith  that ther maketh no man hym 
<lb/>self riche  if he do harm to another wight  </ab><ab n="614">(base) this is to seyn 
<lb/>that nature defendeth and forbedeth by right that no man make 
<lb/>hym self riche vn to the harm of another persone </ab><ab n="615">(base) And Tullius seith that no sorwe ne no drede of deeth ne no thyng 
<lb/>that may falle vn to a man </ab><ab n="616">(base) is so muchel ageyns nature as a 
<lb/>man to encresse his owene profit to the harm of another man  </ab><ab n="617">(base) And thogh the grete men and the myghty men geten richesses

<lb/>by cause of the grete coold and in somer by encheson of

<lb/>right as men blamen an Auarous man by cause of his scarsitee and chyncherie  </ab><ab n="631">(base) in the same wise is he to blame that spendeth ouer largely </ab><ab n="632">(base) and therfore seith Catoun  Vse he seith thy 
<lb/>richesses that thow hast ygeten </ab><ab n="633">(base) in swich a manere that men haue 
<lb/>no matere ne cause to calle thee neither wrecche ne chynche </ab><ab n="634">(base) for it is greet shame to a man to haue a poore herte and a 
<lb/>riche purs  </ab><ab n="635">(base) he seith also the goodes that thow hast ygeten vse 
<lb/>hem by mesure that is to seyn Spende mensurably </ab><ab n="636">(base) For they 
<lb/>that folily wasten and despenden the goodes that they han  </ab><ab n="637">(base) whan 
<lb/>they han namoore propre of hir owene  they shapen hem to 
<lb/>take the goodes of another man  </ab><ab n="638">(base) I seye thanne that ye shal

<lb/>man repreueth the Auaricious man and seith thus in two

<lb/>may in any manere displese god that is youre Creatour 
<lb/>and makere  </ab><ab n="658">(base) For after the word of Salomon It is bettre to haue 
<lb/>alitel good with the loue of god  </ab><ab n="659">(base) than to haue mychel good and 
<lb/>tresor and lese the loue of his lord god  </ab><ab n="660">(base) And the prophete seith  
<lb/>That bettre it is to been a good man and haue alitel good and 
<lb/>tresor  </ab><ab n="661">(base) than to be holden a shrewe and haue grete richesses  </ab><ab n="662">(base) And 
<lb/>yet seye I ferther moore that ye sholden alwey doon youre 
<lb/>bisynesse to gete yow richesses </ab><ab n="663">(base) so that ye gete hem with good 
<lb/>conscience  </ab><ab n="664">(base) And thapostle seith that ther nys thyng in this 
<lb/>world of which we sholden haue so greet ioye as whan 
<lb/>oure conscience bereth vs good witnesse  </ab><ab n="665">(base) And the wise man 
<lb/> seith  The substance of a man is ful good whan synne is

<lb/>it auaileth a man to haue good name than for to haue grete 
<lb/>richesses </ab><ab n="669">(base) And therfore he seith in another place  do greet

<lb/>sholde han to god moore and moore  </ab><ab n="286">(base) and therfore if a man charge hym self with manye

<lb/>hym al the loue that he hath to Ihesu crist  </ab><ab n="287">(base) and in this wise skippeth venial in to dedly synne for certes the moore that a man chargeth his soule with venial synnes the moore is he enclyned to

<lb/>kyng Ezechiel to god I wol remenbre me alle the yeres of my lif in bitternesse of myn herte  </ab><ab n="910">(base) this condicioun of bitternesse 
<lb/>hath fyue signes The firste is that confessioun moste be shamefast nat 
<lb/>for to couere ne hyden his synne for he hath agilt his god and defouled his 
<lb/>soule  </ab><ab n="911">(base) And ther of seith Seint Augustyn the herte trauailleth for shame 
<lb/>of his synne and for he hath greet shamefastnesse he is digne to haue 
<lb/>greet mercy of god </ab><ab n="912">(base) Swich was the confessioun of the Puplican that wolde nat 
<lb/>heuen vp hise eyen to heuene for he hadde offended god of heuene for 
<lb/>which shamefastnesse he hadde anon the mercy of god </ab><ab n="913">(base) And ther of seith 
<lb/>seint Augustyn that swich shamefast folk been next foryeuenesse 
<lb/>and remissioun  </ab><ab n="914">(base) Another signe is humylitee in confessiou of which seith 
<lb/>seint Peter humbleth yow vnder the myght of god the hond of god is 
<lb/>myghty in confessioun for ther by god foryeueth thee thy synnes for he 
<lb/>allone hath the power </ab><ab n="915">(base) and this humylitee shal been in herte and in signe 
<lb/>outward for right as he hath humylitee to god in his herte right so sholde he hunble his body outward to the preest that sit in goddes place  </ab><ab n="916">(base) For 
<lb/>which in no manere sith that crist is souereyn and the preest meene and mediatour 
<lb/>bitwixe crist and the synner and the synnere is the laste by wey of resoun </ab><ab n="917">(base) thanne 
<lb/>sholde nat the synner sitte as heighe as his confessour but knele biforn 
<lb/>hym or at his feet but if maladie destourbe it For he shal nat taken 
<lb/>kepe who sit there but in whos place that he sitteth   </ab><ab n="918">(base) A man that hath 
<lb/>trespased to a lord and comth for to axe mercy and maken his accord and set him 
<lb/>doun anon by the lord men wolde holden hym outrageous and nat worthy 
<lb/>so soone for to haue remissioun ne mercy </ab><ab n="919">(base) The thridde signe is how that 
<lb/>thy shrift sholde be ful of teeris if man may and if man may nat wepe with hise bodily eyen lat hym wepe in herte  </ab><ab n="920">(base) swich was the confession of seint Peter for after that he hadde forsake Ihesu crist he wente out and weep ful bitterly </ab><ab n="921">(base) The fourthe signe is that he ne lette nat

<lb/>for the giltes of a man was obedient to the deeth </ab><ab n="924">(base) The seconde 
<lb/>condicioun of verray confession is that it be hastily doon for certes if a man

<lb/>hym self the moore wolde it corrupte and haste hym to his deeth

<lb/>man oghte hastily shewen hise synnes for manye causes as for 
<lb/>drede of deeth that cometh ofte sodeynly and no certeyn what tyme it 
<lb/>shal be ne in what place and eek the drecchynge of o synne draweth 
<lb/>In another </ab><ab n="927">(base) and eek the lenger that he tarieth the ferther he is fro crist 
<lb/>And if he abide to his laste day scarsly may he shryuen hym or remembre 
<lb/>hym of hise synnes or repenten hym for the greuous maladie of his deeth </ab>
<lb/><ab n="928">(base) and for as muche as he ne hath nat in his lyf herkned Ihesu crist whanne he 
<lb/>hath spoken he shal crie to Ihesu crist at his laste day and scarsly wol he herkne hym </ab><ab n="929">(base) And vnderstond that this condicioun moste han foure thynges Thi 
<lb/>shrift moste be prueyed bifore and auysed for wikked haste dooth no profit 
<lb/>and that a man konne shryue hym of hise synnes be it of pride or of Enuye

<lb/>countrewaite hym self that he fle the occasiouns of synne to whiche he 
<lb/>is enclyned </ab><ab n="932">(base) Also thou shalt shryue thee of alle thy synnes to o man

<lb/>ete by mesure that is for to seyn a man shal nat ete in vntyme ne 
<lb/>sitte the lenger at his table to ete for he fasteth </ab><ab n="978">(base) Thanne shaltow vnderstonde that bodily peyne stant in disciplyne or techynge by 
<lb/>word and by writynge or in ensample Also in werynge of heyres 
<lb/>or of stamyn or of haubergeons on hir naked flessh for cristes sake

<lb/>penaunce and this is in iiij maneres that is drede shame 
<lb/>hope and wanhope that is desperaciou </ab><ab n="984">(base) And for to speke first 
<lb/>of drede for which he demeth that he may suffre no penaunce </ab>
<lb/><ab n="985">(base) ther agayns is remedie for to thynke that bodily penaunce is 
<lb/>but short and litel at regard of the peynes of helle that is so 
<lb/>crueel and so long that it lasteth with outen ende </ab><ab n="986">(base) Now again 
<lb/>the shame that a man hath to shryuen hym and namely thise 
<lb/>ypocrites that wolden been holden so perfite that they han no nede

<lb/>thanne he wol shryuen hym and as he seith hym semeth thanne 
<lb/>tymely ynough to come to shrifte   </ab><ab n="993">(base) Another is Surquidrie that he hath 
<lb/>in cristes mercy </ab><ab n="994">(base) Agayns the firste vice he shal thynke that oure 
<lb/>lif is in no sikernesse and eek that alle the richesses in this world ben 
<lb/>in auenture and passen as a shadwe on the wal  </ab><ab n="995">(base) and as seith seint 
<lb/>Gregorie that it aperteneth to the grete rightwisnesse of god that neuere

<lb/>synne hir thankes but ay continue in synne For thilke perpetueel wil 
<lb/>to do synne shul they han perpetueel peyne </ab><ab n="996">(base) wanhope is in two maneres the firste wanhope is in the mercy of crist that oother is that they 
<lb/>thynken that they ne myghte nat longe perseuere in goodnesse </ab><ab n="997">(base) The firste 
<lb/>wanhope comth of that he demeth that he hath synned so greetly and 
<lb/>so ofte and so longe leyn in synne that he shal nat be saued </ab><ab n="998">(base) Certes agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he thynke that the passion of Ihesu 
<lb/>crist is moore strong for to vnbynde than synne is strong for to 
<lb/>bynde </ab><ab n="999">(base) Agayns the seconde wanhope he shal thynke that as ofte as he falleth he may arise agayn by penitence And though he neuer 
<lb/>so longe haue leyn in synne the mercy of crist is alwey redy to receiuen 
<lb/>hym to mercy </ab><ab n="1000">(base) Agayns the wanhope that he demeth that he sholde 
<lb/>nat longe perseuere in goodnesse he shal thynke that the feblesse of the 
<lb/>deuel may no thyng doon but if men wol suffren hym  </ab><ab n="1001">(base) and eek 
<lb/>he shal han strengthe of the help of god and of al hooly chirche and 
<lb/>of the proteccioun of Aungels if hym list </ab><ab n="1002">(base) Thanne shal men vnder 
<lb/>stonde what is the fruyt of penaunce And after the word of Ihesu crist
