Ox1 notes
A single bifolium only, numbered 1r through 2v, beginning with the last 28 lines of L1 on 1r followed by the first 21 lines of MI on 1v. The other half of the bifolium has MI 325-362 on the recto, 363-402 on the verso.  The intermediate c. 300 lines would have occupied two bifolia, suggesting that this bifolium would have been the second in a gathering of a standard four bifolia. It is possible that this one bifolium survived because the first verso has a handsome portrait (the Miller?) in three-quarter page frame.

Manly and Rickert calculate that this bifolium was the second outer bifolium in the sixth quire of the original manuscript which contained both this bifolium and the three bifolia and five leaves preserved in Ox2.  Following their suggestion, we number these two leaves as folios 42 and 47.

1r: 42
2: 47
