St notes

The manuscript consists of 8 quires of 8 (64 folios) and a final irregular quire, foliated by Mosser as "5+1". In the traditional foliation, folios 10 and 11 are numerated as "10" and "10*", folios 49 and 50 as "48" and "48*".  There is a singleton added after the last leaf of quire 8, hence "64a" in our numbering.  TM is on folios 35r-45r in our numbering.
Note the omission of TM 170-203 on 40r, and the abbreviation of the text  in 44r col a, between TM 351 and 437; 44v col a, between TM 450-533; 45r col a, between TM 547-654; 45v col b between TM 677 and 911.
