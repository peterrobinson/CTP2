<lb/>with outen punysshynge  </ab><ab n="502">(base) they somne nat a man al oonly for to 
<lb/>do newe wronges but they comanden it </ab><ab n="503">(base) Also a wys man seith 
<lb/>That the Iuge that correcteth nat the synnere  comandeth and biddeth

<lb/>shul fynde in manye thynges that I haue shewid yow er this  
<lb/>that hir condicioun is bettre than youres </ab><ab n="510">(base) and therfore seye I 
<lb/>that it is good as now that ye suffre and be pacient </ab><ab n="511">(base) Forther 
<lb/>moore ye knowen wel that after the comune sawe  it is a woodnesse a man to stryue with a strenger or a moore myghty man 
<lb/>than he is hym self </ab><ab n="512">(base) and for to stryue with a man of euene strengthe that is to seyn with as strong a man as he is  it is peril </ab><ab n="513">(base) and for to stryue with a wayker man it is folye  </ab><ab n="514">(base) and therfore 
<lb/>sholde a man fle stryuynge as muchil as he myghte  </ab><ab n="515">(base) For Salomon seith  It is a greet worshipe to a man to kepen hym fro

<lb/>in his Epistle That pacience is 
<lb/>a greet vertu of perfeccioun </ab><ab n="548">(base) Certes quod Melibe I graunte

<lb/>myn herte may neuere be in pees vn to the tyme it be

<lb/>wyl and hir corage  </ab><ab n="554">(base) And therfore me thynketh men oghten nat

<lb/>thogh I do a greet excesse that is to seyn that I venge oon outrage by another </ab><ab n="556">(base) A quod dame Prudence ye seyn youre wil 
<lb/>and as yow liketh  </ab><ab n="557">(base) But in no caas of the world a man sholde nat do outrage ne excesse for to vengen hym  </ab><ab n="558">(base) For Cassidore seith  That as yuele dooth he that vengeth hym by outrage as he that dooth the outrage  </ab><ab n="559">(base) And ther fore ye shul venge 
<lb/>yow after the ordre of right  that is to seyn by the lawe 
<lb/>and nat by excesse ne by outrage  </ab><ab n="560">(base) And also if ye wol venge yow of the outrage of youre Aduersaries in oother manere 
<lb/>than right comandeth  ye synnen  </ab><ab n="561">(base) And therfore seith Senek  That a man shal neuere venge shrewednesse by shrewednesse </ab><ab n="562">(base) And if ye seye that right axeth a man to defende violence by violence and fightynge by fightynge  </ab><ab n="563">(base) Certes ye seye sooth whan the defense is doon anon with 
<lb/>outen interualle or with outen taryynge or delay </ab><ab n="564">(base) for to defenden hym and nat for to vengen hym  </ab><ab n="565">(base) And it bihoueth that

<lb/>haue no cause ne matere to repreuen hym that defendeth 
<lb/>hym of excesse and outrage  for ellys were it agayn reson </ab><ab n="567">(base) Pardee ye knowe wel that ye

<lb/>youre dede attemprely </ab><ab n="569">(base) and therfore me thynketh that 
<lb/>pacience is good  For Salomon seith  That he that is nat

<lb/>that that toucheth hym nat and that aperteneth nat vn to hym 
<lb/>thogh it harme hym it is no wonder  </ab><ab n="571">(base) For the lawe seith 
<lb/>That he is coupable that entremetteth hym or medleth with

<lb/>seith That he that entremeteth of the noyse or stryf of

<lb/>the erys </ab><ab n="573">(base) for right as he that taketh a straunge hound by

<lb/>the same wise is it resoun that he haue harm that by hys

<lb/>where as it aperteneth nat vn to hym  </ab><ab n="575">(base) But ye knowe 
<lb/>wel that this dede that is to seyn my grief and my desese 
<lb/> toucheth me right ny </ab><ab n="576">(base) And therfore thogh I be wrooth and

<lb/>nat se that it myghte greetly harme me thogh I tooke vengeance </ab><ab n="578">(base) for I am richere and moore myghty than myne enemys been </ab><ab n="579">(base) and wel knowen ye that by moneye and by hauynge grete possessions been alle the thynges of this world 
<lb/>gouerned  </ab><ab n="580">(base) And Salomon seith  That alle thynges obeyen to moneye </ab><ab n="581">(base) Whanne Prudence hadde herd hir housbonde auanten hym of his richesse and of his moneye 
<lb/>dispreisynge the power of his Aduersaries  she spak and 
<lb/>seyde in this wise  </ab><ab n="582">(base) Certes deere sire I graunte yow 
<lb/>that ye been riche and myghty </ab><ab n="583">(base) and that the richesses been goode 
<lb/>to hem that han wel ygeten hem and that wel konne vsen 
<lb/>hem  </ab><ab n="584">(base) For right as the body of a man may nat lyue with 
<lb/>oute the soule  namoore may it lyue with oute the temporel goodes </ab><ab n="585">(base) and by richesses may a man gete hym grete </ab><ab n="586">(base) And therfore seith Pamphilles  If Anetherdes doghter 
<lb/>he seith be riche  she may chese of a thousand men which 
<lb/>she wol take to hir housbonde  </ab><ab n="587">(base) for of a thousand men  oon 
<lb/>wol nat forsaken hire ne refusen hire  </ab><ab n="588">(base) And this Pamphilles seith also  If thow be right happy that is to seyn

<lb/>seith this Pamphilles moore ouer That they that been

<lb/>pouerte the moder of Ruyne </ab><ab n="595">(base) that is to seyn the moder of 
<lb/>ouerthrowynge or fallynge down </ab><ab n="596">(base) And therfore seith Piers 
<lb/>Alfonce  Oon of the gretteste Aduersitees of this world is </ab><ab n="597">(base) whan a free man by kynde or of burthe is constreyned 
<lb/>by pouerte to eten the almesse of his enemy  </ab><ab n="598">(base) And the 
<lb/>same seith Innocent in oon of his bookes  he seith That 
<lb/>sorweful and myshappy is the condicioun of a poore beggere </ab><ab n="599">(base) for if he axe nat his mete  he dyeth for hungir </ab><ab n="600">(base) And if he axe he dyeth for shame and algates necessitee constreyneth 
<lb/>hym to axe  </ab><ab n="601">(base) And therfore seith Salomon  That bettre is to dye 
<lb/>than for to haue swich pouerte  </ab><ab n="602">(base) And as the same Salomon seith 
<lb/>Bettre it is to dye of bitter deeth than for to lyuen in swich 
<lb/>wise </ab><ab n="603">(base) By thise resons that I haue seyd vn to yow and by manye othere resons that I koude seye </ab><ab n="604">(base) I graunte yow that richesses been goode to hem that geten hem wel and to hem that wel 
<lb/>vsen tho richesses  </ab><ab n="605">(base) And ther fore wol I shewe yow how ye 
<lb/>shul haue yow and how ye shul bere yow in gaderynge of 
<lb/>richesses and in what manere ye shul vsen hem </ab><ab n="606">(base) First ye 
<lb/>shul geten hem with outen greet desir by good leiser sekyngly 
<lb/>and nat ouer hastily   </ab><ab n="607">(base) For a man that is to desirynge to geten 
<lb/>richesses abandoneth hym first to thefte and to alle othere yueles  </ab><ab n="608">(base) And ther fore seith Salomon  he that hasteth hym to bisily to wexe riche shal be noon Innocent  </ab><ab n="609">(base) He seith also that 
<lb/>the richesse that hastily cometh to a man  soone and lightly gooth 
<lb/>and passeth from a man  </ab><ab n="610">(base) But that richesse that cometh litel and 
<lb/>litel wexeth alwey and multiplieth  </ab><ab n="611">(base) And sire ye shullen gete 
<lb/>richesses by youre wit and by youre trauaille vn to youre profit </ab><ab n="612">(base) and that with outen wrong or harm doynge to any oother 
<lb/>persone  </ab><ab n="613">(base) For the lawe seith  that ther maketh no man hym 
<lb/>self riche  if he do harm to another wight  </ab><ab n="614">(base) this is to seyn 
<lb/>that nature defendeth and forbedeth by right that no man make 
<lb/>hym self riche vn to the harm of another persone </ab><ab n="615">(base) And Tullius seith that no sorwe ne no drede of deeth ne no thyng 
<lb/>that may falle vn to a man </ab><ab n="616">(base) is so muchel ageyns nature as a 
<lb/>man to encresse his owene profit to the harm of another man  </ab><ab n="617">(base) And thogh the grete men and the myghty men geten richesses 
<lb/>moore lightly than thow  </ab><ab n="618">(base) yet shaltow nat be ydel ne slow 
<lb/>to do thy profit for thow shalt in alle wise fle ydelnesse  </ab><ab n="619">(base) For 
<lb/>Salomon seith  that ydelnesse techeth a man to do manye yueles  </ab><ab n="620">(base) And the same Salomon seith  that he that trauaileth and bisieth 
<lb/>hym to tilien his lond  shal ete breed </ab><ab n="621">(base) but that is ydel and 
<lb/>casteth hym to no bisynesse ne ocupacioun shal falle in to pouerte and dye for hunger </ab><ab n="622">(base) And he that is ydel and slow  kan neuere fynde couenable tyme for to do his profit  </ab><ab n="623">(base) For ther is a 
<lb/>versifiour seith  that the ydel man excuseth hym in wynter 
<lb/>by cause of the grete coold and in somer by encheson of 
<lb/>the hete  </ab><ab n="624">(base) For thise causes seith Caton  waketh and enclineth yow nat ouer mychel for to slepe  for ouer mychel 
<lb/> reste norissheth and causeth manye vices  </ab><ab n="625">(base) And therfore seith  
<lb/>Seint Ierome Dooth somme goode dedes that the deuel which is oure enemy ne fynde yow nat vnocupied </ab><ab n="626">(base) for the deuel ne taketh 
<lb/>nat lightly vn to his werkynge swiche as he fyndeth ocupied 
<lb/>in goode werkes </ab><ab n="627">(base) Thanne thus In getynge richesses ye mosten fle ydelnesse </ab><ab n="628">(base) and afterward ye shul vse the richesses whiche 
<lb/>ye haue geten by youre wit and by youre trauaille </ab><ab n="629">(base) in swich a

<lb/>That troubled eyen han no cleer sighte </ab><ab n="732">(base) but seieth and conseileth me as yow liketh for I am redy to do right as ye wol 
<lb/>desire </ab><ab n="733">(base) and if ye repreue me of my folie  I am the moore holden

<lb/>deceyueth hym by swete wordes </ab><ab n="736">(base) Thanne seyde dame Prudence I make no semblant of wrathe ne of angir but for youre grete profit  </ab><ab n="737">(base) For Salomon seith  he is moore worth that repreueth or 
<lb/>chideth a fool for his folie shewynge hym semblant of wrathe  </ab><ab n="738">(base) than he that supporteth hym and preiseth hym in his mysdoynge and laugheth at his folie  </ab><ab n="739">(base) And this same Salomon seith

<lb/>seyn by the sory and heuy contenance of a man  </ab><ab n="740">(base) the fool correcteth
