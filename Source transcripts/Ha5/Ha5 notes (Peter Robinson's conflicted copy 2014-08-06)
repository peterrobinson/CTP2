Ha5 notes

Considerable loss of leaves at the beginning, end, and within the manuscript have rendered the Tales incomplete. Mosser reconstructs the manuscript as 25 quires of 8, with an unknown number of further quires missing at the end.  The extant manuscript begins with KT 344, on the third leaf of a quire missing its first two leaves: at around 33 lines per side, 66 per folio, the whole of the GP (c. 850 lines) and the beginning of KT (c. 340 lines) would have required two full quires of eight and the first two missing leaves of this quire: eighteen folios, and hence c. 1188 lines.  Accordingly, we foliate the first surviving leaf as 19r. Within the surviving quires: the first leaf and second bifolium, 2.7, are missing from quire 1 (folios 17, 18 and 23); the seventh leaf from quire 5 (folio 39); the first leaf from quire 6 (folio 41); the fourth leaf from quire 7 (folio 52); the innermost bifolium 4.5 from quire 11 (folios 84 and 85), the sixth leaf, with no loss of text, from quire 12 (folio 94); the two innermost bifolia 3.6 and 4.5 from quire 13 (folios 99 to 102); the innermost bifolia 4.5 from quires 17 and 18 (folios 132 and 133; 140 and 141); the first two leaves from quire 19 (folios 145 and 146); the last two leaves from quire 22 (folios 175 and 176), with no loss of text, with L20 on 177r following from SQ, which finishes on folio 174r (174v is blank).

Absent text corresponding to the missing folios is as follows: GP and KT 1-343 (folios 1-18); KT 617-684 (folio 23); KT 1705-1772 (folio 39); KT 1841-1910 (folio 41); MI 261-328 (folio 52); ML 1014-end (c. 24 lines); WBP 1-102 (folios 84 and 85; WBT 912-1183 (folios 99-102); CL 230-365 (folios 132-133); CL 768-901 (folios 140-141); CL 1106-end (c. 70 lines), ? L13 L14 (36 + 8 lines), L15 1-23 (folios 145-146; c. 132 lines). The last extant folio, 200v, concludes with PD 348, thus lacking all of Fragment 7, MA and PA.
