MA Notes

The main bulk of the manuscript consisted of eight gatherings of 24 folios (192 leaves), with the Canterbury Tales beginning on the first folio of these eight gatherings and finishing on 194r: the recto of the 21st folio of the last quire. An unrelated poem and a list of kings appear on the verso of this folio, and on the next folio, which is the last remaining of this quire as the final two leaves are not present (not noted by Mosser). Two conjugate leaves, folios 196-197, are bound last in the manuscript. It appears that in the course of its original construction, a gathering of three bifolia (six leaves) was prefixed before the first of these eight gatherings.  The first of these leaves was used as a pastedown, and we follow Mosser in excluding this from the foliation.  The next two leaves of this first gathering (folios 1 and 2) are blank, and three short poems are written by the scribe of the Canterbury Tales section on the next three leaves (folios 3-5) of the first gathering.  Thus, the first leaf of the second gathering, on which the Tales start, is folio 6.
