Despite considerable loss of leaves, the initial structure of the manuscript, as nine quires of 24 folios, so 216 folios, is clear. There is extensive loss of folios in the first and last quires.  In the first quire, the outer four bifolia (folios 1.24, 2.23, 3.22, 4.21), three bifolia with folios 9.16, 10.15, 11.14 and the fifth folio are missing.  In the last quire, the last eleven folios  are missing.  In addition, folios 25 and 37 are missing from the second quire; the innermost bifolium folios 60.61 are missing from from the third quire; the bifolium of folios 128.137 is missing from the sixth quire; the bifolium of folios 155.158 and folio 163 are missing from the seventh quire; and folio 188 from the eighth quire.
Corresponding loss of text is as follows: GP 1-254 (folios 1-5); GP 507-758 (folios 9-11); KT 62-312 (folios 14-16); KT 644-1073 (folios 21-25); KT 2063-2152 (folio 37); ML 432-612 (folios 60-61); FK 1-45, and its headlink (folio 128); FK 762-848 (folio 137); SH 393-end, 1-21 PR and headlink (folio 155); PR 194-end, 1-33 TT and headlink (folio 158); TM 91-130 (folio 163); NP headlink 24-end, NP 1-69 (folio 188).   The manuscript finishes on 205v, at CY 136. The eleven folios missing from this quire would not be sufficient to hold MA, PA, RT and the associated links (which would require 626 lines CY, 104 L36, 258 MA, 74 L37 = 1062 = 13 folios; plus PA: approx 26 folios).

blank are: folios 127r (end SQ, preceding missing folio with FK), 150r (end PD, preceding SH).
