==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

London, British Library Lansdowne MS 851. Mosser: La.

==== Original construction  ====

32 quires of 8: 256 folios.

==== Missing folios  ====

The last leaf of quire 30 (folio 239), and the last folio of the last quire present as a stub (folio 256)

==== Absent text corresponding to the missing folios  ====

PA 398-437 (folio 239).

==== Notes  ====

Mosse includes in the manuscript foliation, as folio 1, the leaf containing John Bale’s Latin account of “Galfridus Chaucer” and his works from his Scriptorum illustrium maioris Brytannie (1557-1559).  As this is not part of the original manuscript, our foliation excludes this leaf, thus beginning CT on 1r, the first leaf of the first quire, not 2r, as Mosser does.
