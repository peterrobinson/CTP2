La Notes
The manuscript consists of 32 quires of 8, with one leaf missing from quire 30 (folio 239), and the last folio of the last quire present as a stub: hence, 254 folios extant.
Mosse includes in the manuscript foliation, as folio 1, the leaf containing John Bale’s Latin account of “Galfridus Chaucer” and his works from his Scriptorum illustrium maioris Brytannie (1557-1559).  As this is not part of the original manuscript, our foliation excludes this leaf, thus beginning CT on 1r, the first leaf of the first quire, not 2r, as Mosser does.
Loss of text corresponding to the missing folio 239 is PA 398-4376.

Missing images: for 5v/6r (GP 381-464); images 160-227 (=folios 156v/157r -- 223v/224r); for 229v-230r (L37 71- PA 45); 235v-236r (PA 261-294); 242v-243r (PA 536-574); 247v-248r (PA 732-770)
