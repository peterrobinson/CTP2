Ph2 notes

The complete manuscript had 30 quires of 8 (240 folios) and two quires of six (quires 27 and 29): 252 folios in total, or 248 if the last quire was a four. The first folio is missing from the first quire (folios 1), without any loss of text; the second folio is missing from quire 30 (folio 230); and the last four folios of the last quire (presuming this was a regular quire of eight) are missing. The traditional numbering skips 229, corresponding to the missing folio 230.

Note omission of PA 342-355 -- near pornographic section dealing with clothes! and 358-362 on the same page 228r; 596-600 omitted on 236v

Absent text corresponding to the missing folios is as follows: PA 409-436 (folio 230); PA 988-end (250ff).
