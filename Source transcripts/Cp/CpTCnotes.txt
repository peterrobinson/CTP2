==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 198. Mosser: Cp.
 
==== Original construction  ====

33 quires of 8 (264 folios) and two of  6 folios: 276 folios. 

==== Missing folios  ====

The first leaf of the first quire (folio 1); the first leaf of quire 14 (folio 103); leaf 7 of quire 17 (folio 133, a stub); leaf 7 of quire 19 (folio 149); the second leaf of quire 23 (folio 176);  leaf 6 from quire 34 (folio 268); and the last three folios (274-276) of the last quire, quire 35.

==== Added folios  ==== 

None.

==== Absent text corresponding to the missing folios  ====

GP 1-72 (folio 1); WBP 146-217 (folio 103); CL 33-108 (folio 133); L13 14-end, ME 1-48 (folio 149); FK 868-end, NU 1-36 (folio 176); L37 62-end, PA 1-29 (folio 268); PA 217-end, RT (folios 274-276).  The three missing folios from quire 35 would not be sufficient to carry the absent text of PA/RT: this would require in the region of 11 to 12 folios, thus probably a further quire of eight as well as the three folios lost from the end of quire 37.

==== Notes  ====

There is confusion in the foliation written on the manuscript itself and in accounts based on that foliation, some of it stemming from previous misbinding in quires 13-15. After folio 64, what we number as folio 65 is numbered as "64b (alt)", folio 66 is numbered "65", with all subsequent numbers out by one. The foliation on the manuscript in this quire reflects its misbinding, now corrected, with folio 117 in this numbering labelled "115a" (previously "106") and folio 118 labelled "115b", thus skipping a second folio in the numbering.  From here to the end of the manuscript, the foliation on the manuscript (reflected in Mosser's numbering) is out by two. 

==== Concordance of the traditional foliation (as reported by Mosser) and the new foliation  ====

|Traditional (Mosser)	| New CT foliation |

|2-64 | 2-64|
|64b (alt) | 65|
|65-101 | 66-102 (CTP 103 absent)|
|102-114  | 104-116 |
|115a | 117|
|115b | 118|
|116-129 | 119-132 (CTP 133 absent)|
|130-144  | 134-148  (CTP 149 absent)|
|145-170   | 150-175 (CTP 176 absent)|
|171-261  |  177-267 (CTP 268 absent)|
|262-266 |  269-273|

(267-269, absent = 274-276, absent)

Note that Mosser incorrectly gives this as 37 quires.  It is actually 35 quires: folios 217-256 extend from quire 29 to 33, not 35, as Mosser 1 gives it.
