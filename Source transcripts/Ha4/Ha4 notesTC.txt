==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

London, British Library Harley MS 7334. Mosser: Ha4.

==== Original construction  ====

35 quires of 8 (280 folios), two quires of 6, and one quire of 2: 294 folios.

==== Missing folios  ====

Quire 21, folios 157-164 (inferred, see "Absent text").

==== Added folios  ====

None.

==== Absent text corresponding to the missing folios  ====

Quire 20 concludes with SQ 608 with the next quire beginning with FK 516, with a  catchword at the base of 156v "and to the wode" referring to SQ 609.  Presuming L20 between SQ and FK, this would amount to around 600 lines of text, and thus a quire of 8, which would have been quire 21. Our numbering assumes this loss, and follows fol. 156 with fol. 165. 

==== Notes  ====

It is notable, as Mosser points out, that the two quires of 6 correspond to  anomalies in the text: the first holds most of TG, which begins on the third folio of quire 8 (59r), after the scribe combines the last two lines of CK into one line at the end of 58v, carries through to the end of the quire (a regular quire of 8) up to line 456, whereupon the scribe uses a quire of 6 to hold the remaining text of TG, concluding on folio 70v, with a space of eleven lines left after the end of TG.  L7 begins the next quire.  Similarly, SQ begins on the first folio of quire 20 (149r), and the scribe precedes this with the second irregular quire of 6, with the end of ME at the top of the last verso  of the quire and generous use of space around L17 in the rest of the page.  In both cases, it appears the scribe already had the next quire copied (or at least started), but had less text than would fill a regular quire of eight for the preceding quire, and so resorted to a quire of 6.  Other evidence of discontinuities in the copying are the two distinct formats for page headings and incipits/explicits found in the MS.  The first, found in quires 1-11, 20, and 26 is characterized by unrubricated (or absent) running heads and explicit/incipits; the second, found in quires 12-19, 22-25, and 31-38, is characterized by rubricated running heads and (often) explicits/incipits.  From quire 26 to 31, the two formats alternate: the second format returns in the last verso of the quire, and continues through quire 27; quire 28 (though unfinished) reverts to the first format; the second format returns in quire 29 and carries through to the end of the manuscript except for the first five folios of quire 30.
