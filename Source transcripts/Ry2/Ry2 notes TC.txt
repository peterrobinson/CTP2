==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

London,  British Library  Royal MS 18.c.ii. Mosser: Ry2.

==== Original construction  ====

32 quires of 8 (256 folios), a quire of 14 (the 30th) and a final quire of four: 274 folios.

==== Missing folios  ====

The final three folios of quire 30, folios 244-246, are missing, as may also be the last folio of the last quire, folio 274, if this is not a pastedown.  

==== Added folios  ====


==== Absent text corresponding to the missing folio  ====
 
There is no text missing following 243v (the thirteenth leaf of quire 30), and there is a catchword on the base of this page, suggesting that the three pages were removed (leaving stubs) before the copying of the manuscript. We retain these three pages in the foliation, to indicated the irregularity at this point.

==== Notes  ====

CT begins on the first leaf of the first folio and continues through to the end of the manuscript.  The manuscript is now preceded by two leaves containing 15th century materials: these leaves are included in the traditional foliation. The two inner bifolia (3.6 and 4.5) in the ninth quire, folios 67/70 (=3.6) and 68/69 (=4.5) have been transposed, so that the order of leaves in this quire is 65 66 68 67 70 69 71 72.

Ry2 notes

The manuscript originally consisted of 32 quires of 8 (256 folios), a quire of 14 (the 30th) and a final quire of four, hence 274 folios. CT begins on the first leaf of the first folio and continues through to the end of the manuscript.  The manuscript is now preceded by two leaves containing 15th century materials: these leaves are included in the traditional foliation. The two inner bifolia (3.6 and 4.5) in the ninth quire, folios 67/70 (=3.6) and 68/69 (=4.5) have been transposed, so that the order of leaves in this quire is 65 66 68 67 70 69 71 72.  The final three folios of quire 30, folios 244-246, are missing, as may also be the last folio of the last quire, folio 274, if this is not a pastedown. However, there is no text missing following 243v (the thirteenth leaf of quire 30), and there is a catchword on the base of this page, suggesting that the three pages were removed (leaving stubs) before the copying of the manuscript.  However, we retain these three pages in the foliation, to indicated the irregularity at this point.

SU is abbreviated at the end, as are several other mss. Note the transition from the first 8 lines of L14 to line 9 of L17. MO finishes at 680, as do many others.

Disarranged folios in Q.9:
order is: 65,66: L7 (finishes base of 66v) with L7 90: 91-97 are missing

NOTE: WE MUST BE MISSING images in quire 9. 
Apparently missing are:


65r/65v: TG 831-902; L7 1-9

66r/66v L7 10-91

67r(71b = Trad 69): ML 75-115 (marked "a") = IMAGE 71b
67v(72a): ML 34-74 (reversed verso and recto!!!) (note at base "iii fo seque[n]ter) (note at base "ij° folio p[re]side[n]t[er] a") = IMAGE 72a [NOT POSSIBLE..????] -- ie verso of 67r??? Mosser must be mistaken.  I don't see "iii fo seque[n]ter" at the base of ANY of these pages

68r(72b): ML 239-279 (marked "c") = IMAGE 72b = Mosser 71r
68v (73a): ML 198-238 (reversed again!) can't be!] (note at base "ij° f° c") = IMAGE 73a.  Mosser claims that the inscription on this page should be "ijo fo° d". I don't see ijo fo° d on any page. He puts "ij° f° c" on his 72v, with 72r having no mark.

69r (73b = trad 71): ML 321-361 (marked "d" = IMAGE 73b)
69v (74a): ML 444-484 (with catchword?? to "saugh of custance" (note at base "ijo fo° d") I don't see "ijo fo° d" on any page

70r (74b): 485-525 
70v (75a): 608-648 


71r (75b): 649-689 
71v (76a): 772-812  (???)

72r (76b): 813-854
72v (77a): 855-89  NO CATCHWORD

Something much wierder has happened here than transposition of 3.6 and 4.5. ML 1-33 are missing entirely, as are 116-197, 280-320, 362-443, 526-607, 690-771.  It is notable that all these, apart from ML 1-33, correspond to what might have been written on complete single folios. And how does the inner bifolium, 68/69, come to have a catchword?

Accordingly: I am retaining the numbering 65-72 as currently bound.  It appears that the later scribal notation on the the ms which Mosser cites as evidence of the transposition of the folios is actually the scribe's recognition of the disorder in the ms, and his attempt to repair it -- but what actually has gone wrong is more than simple transposition. Here is what I think happened:
 The scribes exemplar for ML existed in a series of single sheets (text now missing is indicated by *:
1. ML 1-33* (probably on the verso, preceded by L7 91-97)
2. ML 34-74, 
3. ML 75-115 
4 and 5. ML 116-197*
6. ML 198-238
7. M 239-279 (
8. ML 280-320* 
9. ML 321-361 
10 and 11. ML 362-443*
12 and 13. ML 444-484, 485-525 (verso)
14 and 15. ML 526-607*
16 and 17. ML 608-648, 649-689 (
18 and 19. ML 690-771*
20 and 21. ML 772-854

According to this explanation: leaves 1, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19 were lost. Leaves 2/3, and 6/7 were transposed, and the sequence copied to yield the order here given.  NOTE: this assumes that the scribe retained the lines per page of the exemplar in the copy.  This is most likely to have happened if 

The confusion in these pages appears to be deepened by what appear as inconsistencies between Mosser and what can be seen on the ms images.

our 67r=M69r=I71b: marked "a"
our 67v=M69v=I72a: Images shows "ij° folio p[re]side[n]t[er] a". M states that 
"iii fo seque[n]ter" is on this page: I don't see this on any page
our 68r=M70r=I72b
