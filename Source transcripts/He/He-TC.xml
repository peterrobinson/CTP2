<lb/>tyme that man falleth be it neuer so ofte that he may arise thurgh 
<lb/>penitence if he haue grace but certeynly it is greet dowithe  </ab><ab n="18">(base) for 
<lb/>as seith Seint Gregorie  vnnethe ariseth he out of his synne 
<lb/>that is charged with the charge of yuel vsage  </ab><ab n="19">(base) and ther fore

<lb/>Now sith that I haue declared yow what thyng is penitence 
<lb/>Now shul ye vnderstonde that ther been iij  accions of penitence  
<lb/> </ab><ab n="22">(base) The firste is that if a man be baptised after that he hath synned   </ab><ab n="23">(base) Seint 
<lb/>Augustyn seith but he be penitent for his olde synful lyf he may 
<lb/>nat bigynne the newe clene lyf  </ab><ab n="24">(base) for certes if he be baptised with 
<lb/>oute penitence of his olde gilt he receyueth the mark of baptesme but nat the grace ne the remissioun of hise synnes til he haue repentance verray  </ab><ab n="25">(base) Another defaute is this that men doon 
<lb/>deedly synne after that they han receyued baptesme  </ab><ab n="26">(base) The 
<lb/>thridde defaute is  that men fallen in venyal synnes after

<lb/>That penitence of goode and of humble folk is the penitence

<lb/>to be put out of holy chirche in lente for slaughtre of children

<lb/>openly of which synne the fame is openly spoken in the contree 
<lb/>and thanne holy chirche by Iugement destreyneth hym for to

<lb/> </ab><ab n="53">(base) Penance is the tree of lyf to hem that it receyuen and he that holdeth 
<lb/>hym in verray penitence is blessed after the Sentence of Salomon  </ab><ab n="54">(base) In this penitence or Contricioun man shal vnderstonde 
<lb/>iiij thynges that is to seyn what is Contricioun and whiche 
<lb/>ben the causes that moeuen a man to Contricioun and how he  
<lb/>  sholde be contrit and what Contricioun auaileth to the soule   </ab><ab n="55">(base) thanne 
<lb/>is it thus that Contricioun is the verray sorwe that a man receyueth

<lb/>that with his precious blood hath delyuered vs fro the bondes of synne and fro the creweltee of the deuel and fro the peynes of helle  
<lb/> </ab><ab n="59">(base) The causes that oghten moeuen a man to Contricioun been vj

<lb/>that thilke remembrance ne be to hym no delit by no wey but gret 
<lb/>shame and sorwe for his gilt for Iob seith Synful men doon

<lb/>yet be ye fouler for youre longe contynuynge in synne and
