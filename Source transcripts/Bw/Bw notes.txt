The complete manuscript, according to Mosser, had 34 quires of eight: 272 folios.  The whole of the first quire, corresponding to GP 1-575, is missing. Thus the extant manuscript has 264 folios.  These are numbered 1-260 in the existing foliation, with four folios foliated outside the numeric sequence: "20b", "20(alt)" (=29-30, following 28, foliated "20a"), "135b(alt)" (=146, following 145, foliated "135a"), "180b(alt)" (=192, following 191, foliated "180a"). The manuscript finishes with MA, finishing towards the bottom of the last recto in the last quire, with the last verso originally blank (now, pen trials etc.)
