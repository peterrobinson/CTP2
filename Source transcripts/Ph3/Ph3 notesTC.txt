==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

Philadelphia, Rosenbach Museum and Library MS 1084/1. Mosser: Ph3.

==== Original construction  ====

35 quires of 8, 280 folios, not including a final lost quire. 

==== Missing folios  ====

A\l the first four quires are lost, and the two outer bifolia (1.8, 2.7) of the fifth quire, so that the first surviving folio is 35. Quires six and seven (folios 41 through 56) are also lost, as are quires 31 through 33 (folios 241-264). The sixth leaf is missing from quire 9 (folio 70); the eighth leaf in quire 12 (folio 96) has been replaced by the eighth leaf of quire 13 (folio 104); quire 13 is also missing its first leaf, the conjugate of folio 104 (folio 97); the last leaf is missing from quire 15 (folio 120), and the seventh leaf from quire 34 (folio 271). Quire 14 (folios 105-112) is misbound to follow quire 12. The manuscript breaks off at 280v, in PA 843.  At around 25 paragraphs a leaf, the remainder of PA with RT would have occupied about seven leaves in a final quire of 8.

 ==== Added folios  ====

==== Notes  ====

Note the unusual large gap at the base of 184v, the end of q. 23, in the middle of L33! also, the abbreviated form of SU, and the rather wierd order of PR L29 (where the scribe seems to notice nothing odd at all about the ref to the previous tale being TM). Also: PD is followed by L25, which usually follows PR, with the first line 'miracle' changed to 'tale'

Note the sequence:
Q 12 folios 89-95, [96] 104
Q 14 folios 105-112
Q 13 folios [97] 98-103
Q 15 folios 113-119
Q 16 folios 121-127
