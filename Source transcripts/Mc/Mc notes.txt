Mc Notes

The manuscript originally consisted of 32 quires of 8, 256 folios, plus fly-leaves.  The first eight quires are lost, and hence our numbering begins on folio 65. Following usual practice, this numbering excludes the two flyleaves at the beginning (i-ii) and the single fly-leaf at the end. Absent text corresponding to the missing folios 1-64 is the whole of GP, KT, L1, MI and the first four lines of RE: around 3860 lines in total, around 30 lines per page.  The text breaks off, on 256v, at CY 338a.

The four lines added at the end of CO on 74v, unique to this MS, are numbered 58-1 to 58-4.

The placement of the whole WBP-SU sequence, between MO and L30, is rather remarkable.
