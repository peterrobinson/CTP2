In partnership with the Canterbury Tales Project, at that time led by Norman Blake in partnership with Peter Robinson and Elizabeth Solopova (up to 1998), and using images and other resources supplied by the Project, the Sheffield team transcribed eight manuscripts in full (Ad3, Corpus, Dd, Gg, Ellesmere, Ha4, Hengwrt, Lansdowne), sections of some seven other manuscripts, and all manuscripts of the Franklin's Tale.  No part of these transcripts is contained in this iteration of the Project.</name>
