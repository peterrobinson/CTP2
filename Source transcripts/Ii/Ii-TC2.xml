<lb/>as seith Seint Gregorie  vnnethe ariseth he out of his synne 
<lb/>that is charged with the charge of yuel vsage  </ab><ab n="19">(base) and ther fore 
<lb/>repentant folk that stynte for to synne and forlete synne er that

<lb/>Now sith that I haue declared yow what thyng is penitence 
<lb/>Now shul ye vnderstonde that ther been iij  accions of penitence

<lb/>Augustyn seith but he be penitent for his olde synful lyf he may 
<lb/>nat bigynne the newe clene lyf  </ab><ab n="24">(base) for certes if he be baptised with 
<lb/>oute penitence of his olde gilt he receyueth the mark of baptesme but nat the grace ne the remissioun of hise synnes til he haue repentance verray  </ab><ab n="25">(base) Another defaute is this that men doon 
<lb/>deedly synne after that they han receyued baptesme  </ab><ab n="26">(base) The 
<lb/>thridde defaute is  that men fallen in venyal synnes after 
<lb/>hire baptesme fro day to day   </ab><ab n="27">(base) ther of seith Seint Augustyn  
<lb/>That penitence of goode and of humble folk is the penitence 
<lb/>of euery day  </ab><ab n="28">(base) The speces of penaunce been iij  that oon of 
<lb/>hem is solempne  Another is commune  and the thridde is priuee  </ab><ab n="29">(base) Thilke penaunce that is solempne is in two maneres as 
<lb/>to be put out of holy chirche in lente for slaughtre of children 
<lb/>and swich manere thyng   </ab><ab n="30">(base) Another is whan man hath synned 
<lb/>openly of which synne the fame is openly spoken in the contree 
<lb/>and thanne holy chirche by Iugement destreyneth hym for to 
<lb/>doon open penance  </ab><ab n="31">(base) Commune penaunce is that preestes enioynen

<lb/>Iugement of god  </ab><ab n="264">(base) I seye for as muche as man is nat obeisaunt 
<lb/>to god that is his lord ther fore is the flessh to hym desobeisaunt 
<lb/> thurgh concupiscence which that yet is clepid norissynne of synne 
<lb/>and occasioun of synne  </ab><ab n="265">(base) therfore al the while that a man hath in hym 
<lb/>the peyne of concupiscence it is impossible but he be tempted 
<lb/>som tyme and moeued in his flessh to synne  </ab><ab n="266">(base) and this thyng may 
<lb/>nat faile as longe as he lyueth it may wel wexe feble and 
<lb/>faile by vertu of baptesme and by the grace of god thurgh penitence  </ab><ab n="267">(base) but fully ne shal it neuere quenche that he ne shal som 
<lb/>tyme be moeued in hym self but if he were al refreided by 
<lb/>siknesse or by malefice of sorcerye or colde drynkes  </ab><ab n="268">(base) for lo 
<lb/>what seith Seint Paul  the flessh coueiteth agayn the spirit and the spirit agayn the flessh they ben so contrarie and so 
<lb/>stryuen that a man may nat alwey do as he wolde  </ab><ab n="269">(base) The 
<lb/>same Seynt Paul after his grete penaunce in water and in 
<lb/>londe in water by nyght and by day in gret peril and in gret 
<lb/>peyne in londe in famyn and thurst in cold and clothlees and 
<lb/>ones stooned almoost to the deth  </ab><ab n="270">(base) yet seyde he Allas I 
<lb/>kaytif man who shal delyuere me fro the prison of my 
<lb/>kaytif body   </ab><ab n="271">(base) And Seint Ierom whanne he longe tyme 
<lb/>hadde woned in desert where as he ne hadde no compaignye but of wilde bestes where as he hadde no mete but 
<lb/>herbes and water to his drynke ne no bed but the naked erthe for which his flessh was blak as an Ethiopen for hete 
<lb/>and ney destroyed for cold  </ab><ab n="272">(base) yet seyde he that the brennynge 
<lb/>of lecherye boylede in al his body  </ab><ab n="273">(base) Wherfore I woot wel 
<lb/>sikerly that they ben deceyued that seyn that they ne be nat 
<lb/>tempted in hire body  </ab><ab n="273-1">(base) As wel may the chorle be saued as the lord 
<lb/> </ab><ab n="274">(base) Witnesse on Seint Iame the Apostel 
<lb/>that seith that euery  wight is tempted in his owene concupiscence that is to seyn that euerich of vs hath matere and occasioun to be tempted of the norissynge of synne that 
<lb/>is in his body   </ab><ab n="275">(base) And therfore seith Seint Iohn the Euangelist If that we seyn that we be with oute synne we deceyuen 
<lb/>vs selue and trouthe is nat in vs  </ab><ab n="276">(base) Now shul ye vnderstonde in what manere that synne wexeth and encresceth in 
<lb/>man the firste thyng is thilke norissynge of synne of 
<lb/>which I spak biforn thilke flesshly concupiscence  </ab><ab n="277">(base) and 
<lb/>after that comth the subieccioun of the deuel this is to 
<lb/>seyn the deueles bely with which he bloweth in man the 
<lb/>fyr of flesshly concupiscence  </ab><ab n="278">(base) and after that a man by 
<lb/>thynketh hym wheither he wol doon or no thilke thyng 
<lb/>to which he is tempted  </ab><ab n="279">(base) and thanne if that a man with stonde 
<lb/> and wayue the firste entisynges of his flessh and of the feend thanne 
<lb/>is it no synne and if so be that he do nat so thanne feeleth he 
<lb/>anon a flawmbe of delit  </ab><ab n="280">(base) and thanne is it good to be war and 
<lb/>kepe hym wel or ellis he wol falle anon into consentynge of 
<lb/>synne and thanne wol he do it if he may haue tyme and place   </ab><ab n="281">(base) And 
<lb/>of this matere seith Moyses by the deuel in this manere The 
<lb/>feend seith  I wol chace and pursue the man by wikked suggestioun 
<lb/>and I wol hente hym by moeuyng or stiryng of synne and I 
<lb/>wol departe my prise or my preye by deliberacioun and my lust 
<lb/>shal ben acompliced in delit I wol drawe my swerd in consentynge  </ab><ab n="282">(base) for certes right as a swerd departeth a thyng in two peces 
<lb/>right so consentynge departeth god fro man and thanne wol I 
<lb/>sle hym with myn hand in dede of synne  thus seyth the feend 
<lb/> </ab><ab n="283">(base) for certes thanne is a man al deed in soule and thus is synne 
<lb/>acompliced by temptacioun by delit and by consentynge and thanne 
<lb/>is the synne clepid actuel  </ab><ab n="284">(base) For sothe synne is in two maneres 
<lb/>outher it venyal or dedly synne  Soothly whan man loueth any creature moore than Ihesu crist oure creatour thanne is it dedly synne and venial synne is it if man loue Ihesu crist lasse 
<lb/>than hym oghte  </ab><ab n="285">(base) for sothe the dede of this venial synne is ful 
<lb/>perilous for it amenuseth the loue that men sholde han to god moore and moore  </ab><ab n="286">(base) and therfore if a man charge hym self with manye 
<lb/>swiche venial synnes certes but if so be that he som tyme descharge hym of hem by shrifte they mowe ful lightly amenuse in 
<lb/>hym al the loue that he hath to Ihesu crist  </ab><ab n="287">(base) and in this wise skippeth venial in to dedly synne for certes the moore that a man chargeth his soule with venial synnes the moore is he enclyned to 
<lb/>falle in dedly synne  </ab><ab n="288">(base) And therfore lat vs nat be necligent to 
<lb/>deschargen vs of venial synnes for the prouerbe seith that manye 
<lb/>smale maketh a greet   </ab><ab n="289">(base) And herkne this ensample  A greet wawe of the See comth som tyme with so greet a violence that it 
<lb/>drencheth the Shipe and the same harm doon som tyme the smale dropes of water that entreth thurgh a litel creuesse in to the 
<lb/>Thurrok and in the botme of the shipe if men be so necligent that men 
<lb/>ne descharge hem nat by tyme  </ab><ab n="290">(base) and therfore al thogh ther be 
<lb/>a difference bitwixe thise two causes of drenchynge algates the 
<lb/>Shipe is dreynt  </ab><ab n="291">(base) right so fareth it som tyme of dedly synne 
<lb/>and of anoyouse venials synnes whan they multiplie in a man 
<lb/>so gretly that thilke worldly thynges that he loueth thurgh which 
<lb/>he synneth venially is as gret in his herte as the loue of 
<lb/> god or moore  </ab><ab n="292">(base) and therfore the loue of euery thyng that is nat byset in god ne doon principally for goddes sake al that a man loue 
<lb/>it lasse than god yet is it venial synne  </ab><ab n="293">(base) and dedly synne whan 
<lb/>the loue of any thyng weyeth in the herte of man as muche 
<lb/>as the loue of god or moore  </ab><ab n="294">(base) Dedly synne as seith Seynt 
<lb/>Augustyn is whan man turneth his herte fro god which that is 
<lb/>verray souereyn bowntee that may nat chaunge and yeueth his herte to a thyng that may chaunge and flitte  </ab><ab n="295">(base) and certes that is euery 
<lb/>thyng saue god of heuene for sooth is that if a man yeue his loue the which that he oweth al to god with al his herte vn to a creature certes as muche of his loue as he yeueth to thilke creature 
<lb/>so muche he bireueth fro god  </ab><ab n="296">(base) and therfore dooth he synne for 
<lb/>he that is dettour to god ne yeldeth nat to god al his dette that 
<lb/>is to seyn al the loue of his herte  </ab><ab n="297">(base) Now sith man vnderstondeth generally which is venial synne thanne is it couenable to 
<lb/>tellen specially of synnes whiche that many a man par auenture 
<lb/>ne demeth hem nat synnes and ne shryueth hym nat of the same thynges and yet nathelees they been synnes  </ab><ab n="298">(base) and soothly as 
<lb/>thise clerkes writen this is to seyn that euery tyme that man eteth 
<lb/>or drynketh moore than suffiseth to the sustenaunce of his body 
<lb/>in certeyn he dooth synne  </ab><ab n="299">(base) and eek whan he speketh moore than 
<lb/>it nedeth it is synne eek whan he herkneth nat benygnely the 
<lb/>compleynte of the pouere   </ab><ab n="300">(base) eek whan he is in heele of body and 
<lb/>wol nat faste whan oother folk fasten with outen cause resonable  eek whan he slepeth moore than nedeth or whan he 
<lb/>comth by thilke encheson to late to chirche or to othere werkes of

<lb/>of engendrure to honour of god or for the entente to yelde to 
<lb/>his wyf the dette of his body   </ab><ab n="302">(base) eek whan he wol nat visite the 
<lb/>syke and the prisoner if he may  eek if he loue wyf or child 
<lb/>or oother worldly thyng moore than reson requereth  eek 
<lb/>if he flatre or blaundise moore than hym oghte for any necessitee   </ab><ab n="303">(base) eek if he amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of

<lb/>by lightnesse or folye mysseyth or scorneth his neighebore 
<lb/> </ab><ab n="306">(base) eek whan he hath any wikked suspecioun of thyng ther he ne woot

<lb/>that he hath to oure lord Ihesu crist and by preyeres and confession 
<lb/>and othere goode werkes so that it shal but litel greue   </ab><ab n="309">(base) for as seith

<lb/>greueth so muche anoyeth a venial synne vn to a man that is 
<lb/>parfit in the loue of Ihesu crist  </ab><ab n="311">(base) Men may also refreyne venial
