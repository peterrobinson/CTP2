II notes

The complete manuscript had 29 quires of 8, for a total of 232 folios, with a quire of 6 (quire 23), and a final quire of a single folio, for a total of 239 folios. The fifth leaf of quire 10 (folio 77) is missing. Unusually, although the first quire is complete with no loss of leaf at the beginning of the quire, the first 66 lines of GP are absent.  As Mosser suggests, it appears that these lines were missing from the exemplar.  In this case, the traditional foliation, which begins at "2" as if at some time there had been a first leaf in this manuscript, is seriously misleading. 
Absent text corresponding to the missing folio 77 is SQ 124-209.
