==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Rawlinson poet. 223 [s.c. 14714]. Mosser: Ra3.

==== Original construction  ====

23 of 12 (276 folios) and two of 8 (the tenth and last quires): 292 folios. 

==== Missing folios  ====

The first seven leaves are missing from the first quire (folios 1-7); the eighth leaf is missing from the sixth quire (folio 68); the last leaf is missing from the tenth quire (folio 116); the last leaf is missing from the eleventh quire (folio 128); the fourth leaf is missing from the thirteenth quire (folio 144); the inner five bifolia 2.11 3.10 4.9 5.8 6.7 are missing from quire 18 (folios 202-211); the sixth and last leaves of quire 25, the last folio in the manuscript (folios 290 and 292).

==== Added folios  ====

After folio 96, the last leaf of the eighth quire, foliated as 96a.

==== Absent text corresponding to the missing folio  ====
 
GP 1-712 (folios 1-7; 172 lines would have taken less than three folios); RE 403-404, L3, CO 1-18 (folio 68); ME 804-872 (folio 128); WBP 673-740 (folio 144); TM 327-798 (folios 202-211); PA 986-end, RT 1007-1012 (folio 290). Folio 291v is blank, as 292 is likely to have been. No text is missing corresponding to folio 116: 115v finishes with the end of the 'Prohemye' of CL, at line 56, marked by an elaborate rubric, with the 'Tale' commencing on the first folio of quire 11, folio 117. This suggests that the scribe planned to begin the new 'tale' with the new quire, as ME commences quire 9. In the case of ME, this meant an extra leaf (96a) had to be added to accommodate the end of SQ; in this case, a leaf has to be removed to avoid a blank leaf between the 'prohemye' and the 'tale' in CL.

==== Notes  ====

The leaf added at the end of quire 8, 96a, carries up to the end of SQ on the recto, with the verso left blank, preceding L20 and ME on the first leaf of quire 9.

KT 516-601 are omitted on 25v. Bizarrely, L28 is written in the same tennis-fixture format used for TT. Also bizarrely: FK is introduced as the Merchant's Prologue.

Ra3 notes

The complete manuscript had 25 quires: 23 of 12 (276 folios) and two of 8 (the tenth and last quires), for a total of 292 folios.  The first seven leaves are missing from the first quire (folios 1-7); the eighth leaf is missing from the sixth quire (folio 68); the last leaf is missing from the tenth quire (folio 116); the last leaf is missing from the eleventh quire (folio 128); the fourth leaf is missing from the thirteenth quire (folio 144); the inner five bifolia 2.11 3.10 4.9 5.8 6.7 are missing from quire 18 (folios 202-211); the sixth and last leaves of quire 25,the last folio in the manuscript (folios 290 and 292). A leaf has been added after folio 96, the last leaf of the eighth quire: we foliate this as 96a.

 

Absent text corresponding to the missing folios is as follows: GP 1-712 (folios 1-7; 172 lines would have taken less than three folios); RE 403-404, L3, CO 1-18 (folio 68); ME 804-872 (folio 128); WBP 673-740 (folio 144); TM 327-798 (folios 202-211); PA 986-end, RT 1007-1012 (folio 290). Folio 291v is blank, as 292 is likely to have been. No text is missing corresponding to folio 116: 115v finishes with the end of the 'Prohemye' of CL, at line 56, marked by an elaborate rubric, with the 'Tale' commencing on the first folio of quire 11, folio 117.
