====  Notes  ====

 Mosser appears to miscount the folios in the last quire: on his account, this is missing five folios, with three remaining, but he enumerates it as 'fols. 174-5', not '174-176'. He also states that the first leaf of quire 25 is missing, although it appears to be present ("ruled but blank") and is indeed included in his numbering. It is counted as present in this foliation. Also, his numbering begins at "3", not "1"
 
The Tales occupies folios 26r to 179v (20r-157v in Mosser's numbering).  No text is lost from the cancelled folio 128 (space is left at the end of 127v, L28; the cancellation allows TM to start a new quire on 129r following directly from L28 on 127v). A space of 12 lines is left at the end of NP on folio 153r, and of 19 lines before MA starts on 153v, apparently to take L36; however, the 100 plus lines of L36 would not have fitted into this space.
