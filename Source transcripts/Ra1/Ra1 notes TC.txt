Ra1 notes

The complete manuscript had 27 quires of 8 (216 folios), and an additional unknown number of quires at the end. There has been considerable loss from the manuscript.  All of the first five quires (folios 1-40), quire 26 (folios 201-208), and an unknown number of quires at the end are missing. The second leaf is missing from the ninth quire (folio 66); the first four leaves from the 21st quire (folios 161-164); the inner bifolium 4.5 from the 23rd quire (folios 180-181); and the inner four leaves (two bifolio 3.6, 4.5?) from the last quire (folios 211-214). The last surviving quire breaks off at MA 36, with a catchword. The manuscript thus lacks FK CY PA PD NU and the associated links.


Absent text corresponding to the missing folios is as follows: GP, KT 1-1708 (folios 1-40; approx 62 lines a folio); RE 241-304 (folio 66); MO 245-411 (folios 161-164); WBP 693-820 (folios 180-181); SU 359-end, NP 1-255   (folios 201-208, c. 228+255 lines, likely including the short form of L30 with 62 lines a folio accommodating c. 500 lines); NP 385-end, L36 1-13 (c. 254 lines; approx 63 lines a folio)
