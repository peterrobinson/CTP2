==== Manuscript name and Mosser link  ====

Oxford, Bodleian Library  MS Rawlinson C.86 [s.c. 11951]. Mosser: Ra4.

==== Original construction  ====

This is an exceptionally complex manuscript, containing two sections of the Tales (CL PR) which occupy some 30 of the manuscripts 189 folios.  The foliation given by Mosser follows Boffey, Griffiths and Meale in giving the intended order of the many items in the manuscript.  We follow here that foliation, without adjusting for missing folios as we do elsewhere. CL occupies 156v-173v, PR 174v-177v, with the two texts separated in the reconstructed order by various brief pieces.
